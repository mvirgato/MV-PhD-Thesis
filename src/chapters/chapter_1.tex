\begin{synopsis}
    Background on DM and its current status
  \end{synopsis}

  A common remark during my time as a PhD candidate was that every 
  possible introductory statement about the nature of Dark Matter 
  (DM) has already been writen. While this is somewhat of an exhageration, 
  one often finds that they have writen what they think is a new and 
  interesting introductory statement, only to find it was exactly what
  you had writen a few papers ago! Therefore, as is the current custom, 
  I defer this task to chat-GPT:

  \begin{displayquote}
  ``In the pursuit of understanding the fundamental constituents 
    of the universe, the nature of dark matter stands as a persistent 
    enigma. Evading direct detection and eluding conventional 
    characterization, dark matter's elusive presence exerts a profound 
    influence on the large-scale structure and dynamics of the cosmos, 
    compelling a rigorous exploration into its inherent mysteries."
  \end{displayquote}
  While this is not at all a unique introduction, it is
  sufficient for us to move on to the interesting parts of the thesis:
  the physics.
