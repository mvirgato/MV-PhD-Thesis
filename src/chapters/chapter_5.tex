\chapter{Dark Matter Induced Heating of Neutron Stars }
\label{chapter:heating}

\begin{synopsis}
  We analyse the various timescales at play when determining the extent of heating dark matter can induce in neutron stars. This heating occurs in two stages. Kinetic heating requires a significant fraction of the dark matter's kinetic energy to be deposited through scattering. Further annihilation heating requires the captures and annihilation rates to come into equilibrium. The timescales for these processes is calculated and compared to the age of the star.
