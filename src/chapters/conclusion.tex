Dark matter is perhaps the most confounding puzzle in modern particle physics. There is a myriad of evidence supporting its existence and yet very little remains known about its true nature. In fact, no observation has been made to either confirm or deny the hypothesis that dark matter has a particle nature. 



Compact objects are the natural successor to searches for dark matter captured within the Sun. They provide unique laboratories within which one can probe DM interactions unachievable anywhere else in the Universe.
