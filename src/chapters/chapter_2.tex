  \fixMV{Check masses in Shapiro}

  The lifecycle of main sequence stars can end in various ways
  depending on the progenitor star's mass. Lighter stars ($~0.6 - 10 \Msun$ at  
  the onset of hydrogen burning) will eventually end their lives as a 
  White Dwarf. Meanwhile,

  The internal structure of 

  For non-relativistic stars, such as our Sun, the structure equations are
  rather simple, them being
  \begin{align}
    \frac{d M}{dr}  &= 4 \pi r^2,\\
    \frac{d P }{dr} &= -\rho(r) G M(r) r^2,
  \end{align}
  where $M$ is the mass of the star at radius $r$, $P$ is the pressure,
  and $\rho(r)$ is the density.
  The first equation is known as the mass equation, and the second is the
  condition for hydrostatic equilibrium. 

  We are instead interested in compact objects, where the extreme densities 
  of these stars 

  In order to solve this system, 
  The equation of state describes the relation between the pressure 
  and energy of the constituent matter.
