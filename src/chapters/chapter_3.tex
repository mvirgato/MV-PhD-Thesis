\chapter{Introduction to Capture in Compact Objects: Point Like Targets}
\label{chapter:capture_1}

\begin{synopsis}
  Review capture in the Sun, move to what's needed for COs in general, then specify to WDs (ions + electrons) and NS (interacting baryons)

  One of the most important quantities we will be interested in is the 
  rate at which darm matter is captured with the star. 
  In this chpater, we focus on building up the formalism of dark matter 
  capture within compact objects, outlining how this differs from the 
  standard calculation for capture in the Sun. We restrict our analysis to 
  scattering off of point-like targets, relevent for leptonic species, 
  i.e. electrons in White Dwarfs and electrons and muons in Neutron Stars.
  The complications that arise due to the finite size of hadronic targets 
  will be discussed in the next chapter.
