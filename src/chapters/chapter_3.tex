\chapter{Capture Part 1: Point Like Targets}
\label{chapter:capture_1}

\begin{synopsis}
Review capture in the Sun, move to what's needed for COs in general, then specify to WDs (ions + electrons) and NS (interacting baryons)
\end{synopsis}

One of the most important quantities we will be interested in is the 
the rate at which dark matter is captured with the star. 
In this chapter, we focus on building up the formalism of dark matter 
capture within compact objects, outlining how this differs from the 
the standard calculation for capture in the Sun. We restrict our analysis to 
scattering off of point-like targets, relevant for leptonic species, 
i.e. electrons in White Dwarfs and electrons and muons in Neutron Stars.
The complications that arise due to the finite size of hadronic targets 
will be discussed in the next chapter.

Before jumping into the capture formalism relevant to compact objects, it will serve us well to review the formalism laid out by Gould for capture in the Sun~\cite{Gould:1987ir_ResonantEnhancementsWIMP}. 

To begin, we consider the flux of dark matter particles that will pass through a spherical shell of the star, located at a radius $r$ from the centre and with thickness $dr$. Away from the star's gravitational field, we will assume that the DM in the Galactic halo follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution function, 
\begin{equation}
    f_\infty(\tilde{u}_\chi) d\tilde{u}_\chi= 4 \pi \left( \frac{3}{2 \pi} \right)^{3/2}\frac{\tilde{u}_\chi^2}{v_d^2} \exp\left(-\frac{3 \tilde u_\chi^2}{2 v_d^2}\right)\,d\tilde u_\chi, 
\end{equation}
where $\tilde u_\chi$ is the DM velocity in the halo, and $v_d$ is the DM halo velocity dispersion.
