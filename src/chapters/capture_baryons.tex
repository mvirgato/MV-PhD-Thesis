\chapter{Capture Rate for Strongly Interacting Baryonic Matter}
\label{chapter:capture_baryons}

\begin{synopsis}
   The capture formalism developed in the previous chapter is extended to baryonic targets inside neutron stars. Additional complications arise due to their finite size and strong interactions between the baryonic species.
