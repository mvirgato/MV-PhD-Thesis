  First and foremost, thank you to my supervisor, Nicole Bell, for all the wisdom, guidance, and support you have provided me over the last five years. 

  % Collaborators
  I was fortunate enough to collaborate with Sandra Robles and Giorgio Busoni on many of the projects I worked on during my candidature. Thank you both for all that you have taught me over these years. In particular, I want to thank Sandra for always pushing me to do the best work possible. Your mentorship was truly appreciated.

  % Panel
  To the members of my advisory panel, Matthew Dolan and Andrew Melatos, thank you for all the guidance and encouragement you have provided over the years.

  % Office mates
  Returning to the office after nearly two years of COVID lockdowns solidified how important working alongside fellow students is to the PhD experience. In particular, I would like to thank Fred Hiskens, Maaz Hyatt, Ayo Ore, Alex Ritter, Alexi Sopov, and Josh Wood for the countless hours of physics (and non-physics) related conversations we shared. You all made that office a truly wonderful place to work.
 
  % Friends
  I was lucky enough to meet and become good friends with many people in and around the physics department throughout my long tenure at this university. In particular, I would like to thank Marcel Hohmann, Mike Mews, Oliver Anagnostou, Daniel Marcantonio, Lachlan Milligan, and Neuton Li. Your friendship over these long years has been truly appreciated.

  % Parents and family
  Finally, I am incredibly thankful to my family for supporting me during this degree. Thank you for the love and encouragement you have provided over the years.
