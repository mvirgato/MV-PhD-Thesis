  abstract = {We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.},

  abstract = {We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M\_sun. We emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.},

If non-annihilating dark matter is captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

Dark matter can be captured by neutron stars via scattering, where kinetic energy is transferred to the star. This can have a number of observational consequences, such as the heating of old neutron stars to infra-red temperatures. Previous treatments of the capture process have employed various approximation or simplifications. We present here an improved treatment of dark matter capture, valid for a wide dark matter mass range, that correctly incorporates all relevant physical effects. These include gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli blocking, neutron star opacity and multi-scattering effects. We provide general expressions that enable the exact capture rate to be calculated numerically, and derive simplified expressions that are valid for particular interaction types or mass regimes and that greatly increase the computational efficiency. Our formalism is applicable to the scattering of dark matter from any neutron star constituents, or to the capture of dark matter in other compact objects.},

We recently developed an improved treatment of dark matter (DM) capture in neutron stars that properly incorporates many of the important physical effects, and outlined useful analytic approximations that are valid when the scattering amplitude is independent of the centre of mass energy. We now extend that analysis to all interaction types. We also discuss the effect of going beyond the zero-temperature approximation, which provides a boost to the capture rate of low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter from leptonic targets, for which a correct relativistic description is essential. We find that the potential neutron star sensitivity to DM-lepton scattering cross sections greatly exceeds electron-recoil experiments, particularly in the sub-GeV regime, with a sensitivity to sub-MeV DM well beyond the reach of future terrestrial experiments.},

  abstract = {White dwarfs, the most abundant stellar remnants, provide a promising means of probing dark matter (DM) interactions, complimentary to terrestrial searches. The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to gravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In particular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark matter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of captured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on either the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions, we account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form factors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects pertinent to sub-GeV dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic, degenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple scattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter evaporation rate. The DM-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be constrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with observations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply this technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster Messier 4, which we assume to be located in a DM subhalo. For DM-nucleon scattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-GeV mass range inaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only by either evaporation or dominant DM annihilation to neutrinos, and can be competitive with direct detection in the \$1-10\^4\$ GeV range. White dwarf limits on dark matter-electron scattering are found to outperform current electron recoil experiments over the full mass range considered, and extend well beyond the \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV mass regime where the sensitivity of electron recoil experiments is reduced.},

In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than \$1\$ year for vector interactions and \$10\^4\$ years for scalar interactions.},

Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars, the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example, a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities \$c\_s\^2 {$>$} 0.1\$ in the cores of 2.1 solar-mass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak first-order phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash rho/\textbackslash rho {$<$} 0.2\$ (at 68\% level) in a Maxwell construction turn out to be still possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter. In view of these data-based constraints, much discussed issues such as the quest for a phase transition towards restored chiral symmetry, and the active degrees of freedom in cold and dense baryonic matter, are reexamined.},

  abstract = {Dark matter with momentum- or velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei has shown significant promise for explaining the so-called Solar Abundance Problem, a longstanding discrepancy between solar spectroscopy and helioseismology. The best-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5 GeV. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun can be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of such models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the first time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions, thermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically thin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that depending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass below which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 GeV. This has the effect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance Problem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also provide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account thermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly matched to the well-known saturation limit.},

Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of DM being captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range of DM mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the solar-captured DM annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the DM indirect detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution in the Sun as well as its kinematics are studied.},

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

Its energy is then transferred to the neutron star as heat through the scattering and annihilation inside the star. This heating effect may be detectable via dedicated temperature observations of nearby old pulsars, providing an alternative method for dark matter searches. In this paper, we show that for electroweak multiplet dark matter this search strategy can probe the parameter region which is out of reach of future dark matter direct detection experiments. To see this systematically, we classify such dark matter candidates in terms of their electroweak charges and investigate the effect of ultraviolet physics by means of higher-dimensional effective operators. We then show that if the effect of ultraviolet physics is sizable, the dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering cross section becomes sufficiently large, whilst if it is suppressed, then the mass splittings among the components of the DM multiplet get small enough so that the inelastic scattering processes are operative. In any case, the electroweak multiplet dark matter particles are efficiently captured in neutron stars, making the search strategy with the temperature observation of old neutron stars promising.},

From elastic scatterings on NS material, DM can get gravitationally trapped by the star. The cooling of DM through further collisions may lead to the formation of a dense core which could collapse into a black hole, thus destroying the whole NS. From the observation of old NS, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric DM. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of DM particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the DM density and energy profiles inside the NS, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, DM thermalizes with NS material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the DM-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of DM particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the DM-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic DM models; and (e) the use of realistic NS equations of state in determining these constraints.},

  abstract = {Scatterings of galactic dark matter (DM) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped. DM particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range \$[10\^\{-10\} - 10\^2]\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$, for constant scattering cross sections and \$s\$-wave annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by \$E\_c/T\_\textbackslash chi \textbackslash sim 30\$, where \$E\_c\$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and \$T\_\textbackslash chi\$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm evap\} \textbackslash simeq 0.7\$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section, the DM evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range \$10\^\{-41\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2 \textbackslash leq \textbackslash sigma\_p \textbackslash leq 10\^\{-31\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2\$, where \$\textbackslash sigma\_p\$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity, or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.},

  abstract = {We calculate the number of dark matter particles that a neutron star accumulates over its lifetime as it rotates around the center of a galaxy, when the dark matter particle is a self-interacting boson but does not self-annihilate. We take into account dark matter interactions with baryonic matter and the time evolution of the dark matter sphere as it collapses within the neutron star. We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions. We show that for a dark matter density of \$\textasciitilde 10\^3\$ GeV/cm\$\^3\$ and dark matter mass \$m\_\textbackslash chi\$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for high dark matter density regions, we find that for \$m\_\textbackslash chi\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV when the dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-52\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ to \$10\^\{-57\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, the dark matter self-interaction cross section limit is \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\}{$<$} 10\^\{-33\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.},

  abstract = {There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

Among these are the first observed binary neutron star merger, GW170817, whose gravitational radiation was accompanied by electromagnetic radiation from a short {$\gamma$}-ray burst and an optical afterglow believed to be due to the radioactive decay of newly minted heavy r-process nuclei. These observations give important constraints on the radii of typical neutron stars and on the upper limit to the neutron star maximum mass and complement recent pulsar observations that established a lower limit. Pulse-profile observations by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) X-ray telescope provide an independent, consistent measure of the neutron star radius. Theoretical many-body studies of neutron matter reinforce these estimates of neutron star radii. Studies using parameterized dense matter equations of state (EOSs) reveal several EOS-independent relations connecting global neutron star properties.},

SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (\textasciitilde 5 dex), and surface brightnesses (\textasciitilde 4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass-HI mass relation and the stellar radius-HI radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the HI mass-radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic-to-observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) at [3.6]. Assuming M/L=0.5 Msun/Lsun (as suggested by stellar population models) we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity, (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of M/L=0.2 Msun/Lsun as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is M/L=0.7 Msun/Lsun at [3.6].

In this work, we investigate spin-\$1/2\$ fermionic DM \$\textbackslash chi\$ charged under the \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson \$V\$ of \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ gauge group can be produced in NS via DM annihilation. The produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model (SM) particles before it exits the NS, despite its tiny couplings to SM particles. Thus, we perform a systematic study on \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2V\textbackslash to4\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ as a new heating mechanism for NS in addition to \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ and kinetic heating from DM-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to \$\textbackslash chi V\$ scattering is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass mixing terms between \$V\$ and SM gauge bosons are present. This allows both vector and axial-vector couplings between \$V\$ and SM fermions even for \$m\_V\textbackslash ll m\_Z\$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches to DM-induced NS heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses. Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the NS surface temperature by the future telescopes are discussed as well.},

Since dark matter does not self-annihilate in the ADM scenario, dark matter accumulates in neutron stars, eventually reaching the Chandrasekhar limit and forming a black hole. We focus on the case of scalar ADM, where the constraints from Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent black hole formation are most severe due to the absence of Fermi degeneracy pressure. We also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space, non-trivial effects from Hawking radiation can modify our limits. We find that for scalar ADM with mass between 100 keV and 10\^5 GeV, the constraint from pulsars in globular clusters on the scattering cross-section with neutrons ranges from \textbackslash sigma\_n {$<$} 10\^\{-45\} cm\^2 to 10\^\{-52\} cm\vphantom\{\}\^2. In particular, for scalar ADM with mass between 1 GeV and 1 TeV (in the case where black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation is unimportant), the constraint on the scattering cross-section is below what is reachable with ton scale direct detection experiments.},

These discoveries show that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematics, we can now make full use of the High Frequency Instrument polarization data. The low-multipole 100x143 GHz EE cross-spectrum constrains the reionization optical-depth parameter \$\textbackslash tau\$ to better than 15\% (in combination with with the other low- and high-\$\textbackslash ell\$ likelihoods). We also update the 2015 baseline low-\$\textbackslash ell\$ joint TEB likelihood based on the Low Frequency Instrument data, which provides a weaker \$\textbackslash tau\$ constraint. At high multipoles, a better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (polarization efficiency or PE) allow us to fully use the polarization spectra, improving the constraints on the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameters by 20 to 30\% compared to TT-only constraints. Tests on the modelling of the polarization demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties, the accuracy of the PE modelling being the main limitation. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-\$\textbackslash ell\$ implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ level. Minor curiosities already present before (differences between \$\textbackslash ell\${$<$}800 and \$\textbackslash ell\${$>$}800 parameters or the preference for more smoothing of the \$C\_\textbackslash ell\$ peaks) are shown to be driven by the TT power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of polarization. Overall, the legacy Planck CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future CMB observations. (Abridged)},

The equation of state, which takes into account the \textbackslash beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear, and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the simple formula \$\textbackslash sqrt\{g\_\{00\}\}\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$= constant, which links the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$ with the general relativistic gravitational potential \$g\_\{00\}\$ at each point of the configuration. The configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as inverse \textbackslash beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of \$\^4\$He, \$\^\{12\}\$C, \$\^\{16\}\$O and \$\^\{56\}\$Fe white dwarfs are presented.

Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

  abstract = {If dark matter (DM) is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that is a thermal relic of the early Universe, then its total self-annihilation cross section is revealed by its present-day mass density. The canonical thermally averaged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP mass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just reached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100\% branching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate goal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass and, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass. Probing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a light WIMP in direct and indirect searches. We revisit the thermal relic abundance calculation for a generic WIMP and show that the required cross section can be calculated precisely. It varies significantly with mass at masses below 10 GeV, reaching a maximum of 5.2*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1 at masses around 0.3 GeV, and is 2.2*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1 with feeble mass-dependence for masses above 10 GeV. These results, which differ significantly from the canonical value and have not been taken into account in searches for annihilation products from generic WIMPs, have a noticeable impact on the interpretation of present limits from Fermi-LAT and WMAP+ACT.},

In such cases astrophysical studies can help to expand the range of values significantly. Among astronomical sources, used in interests of fundamental physics, compact objects -- neutron stars and white dwarfs, -- play a leading role. We review several aspects of astroparticle physics studies related to observations and properties of these celestial bodies. Dark matter particles can be collected inside compact objects resulting in additional heating or collapse. We summarize regimes and rates of particle capturing as well as possible astrophysical consequences. Then we focus on a particular type of hypothetical particles -- axions. Their existence can be uncovered due to observations of emission originated due to Primakoff process in magnetospheres of neutron stars or white dwarfs. Alternatively, they can contribute to cooling of these compact objects. We present results in these areas, including upper limits based on recent observations.},

  abstract = {We consider current observational constraints on the electromagnetic charge of dark matter. The velocity dependence of the scattering cross-section through the photon gives rise to qualitatively different constraints than standard dark matter scattering through massive force carriers. In particular, recombination epoch observations of dark matter density perturbations require that \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, the ratio of the dark matter to electronic charge, is less than \$10\^\{-6\}\$ for \$m\_X = 1 GeV\$, rising to \$\textbackslash epsilon {$<$} 10\^\{-4\}\$ for \$m\_X = 10 TeV\$. Though naively one would expect that dark matter carrying a charge well below this constraint could still give rise to large scattering in current direct detection experiments, we show that charged dark matter particles that could be detected with upcoming experiments are expected to be evacuated from the Galactic disk by the Galactic magnetic fields and supernova shock waves, and hence will not give rise to a signal. Thus dark matter with a small charge is likely not a source of a signal in current or upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments.},

  abstract = {(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68\% confidence) of sigma/m {$<$} 1.25 cm\^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m {$<$} 0.7 cm\^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm\^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.},

Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations.

  abstract = {(Abridged) We present an analysis of a Chandra ACIS-S observation of the elliptical galaxy NGC 720 to verify the existence of a dark matter (DM) halo and to measure its ellipticity. The ACIS-S3 image reveals over 60 point sources. For semi-major axes a{$<$}\textasciitilde 150 (18.2h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} kpc) the ellipticity of the diffuse emission is ex \textasciitilde 0.15, which is less than the values 0.2-0.3 obtained from ROSAT because the point sources contaminated the ROSAT values. The Chandra data confirm the \textasciitilde 20 deg position angle (PA) twist discovered by ROSAT, but the Chandra twist is more gradual also because of the point sources contaminating the ROSAT values. Overall the ex and PA values for a{$<$}\textasciitilde 150 can be explained by the triaxial model of NGC 720 published by Romanowsky \& Kochanek. Since the optical image displays no substantial isophote twisting, the X-ray PA twist requires a massive DM halo if the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The mass-follows-light hypothesis is also inconsistent with the Chandra ellipticities at the 96\% (98\%) level for oblate (prolate) symmetry. Thus, both the PA twist and the ellipticities of the Chandra image imply a DM halo independent of the gas T profile -- evidence that cannot be obviated by alternative gravity theories such as MOND. The DM density model, rho \textasciitilde a\^\{-2\}, provides the best fit and gives ellipticities of 0.37 +/- 0.03 (0.36 +/- 0.02) for oblate (prolate) models. These moderate ellipticities for the DM halo are inconsistent with both the nearly spherical halos predicted if the DM is self-interacting and with the highly flattened halos predicted if the DM is cold molecular gas. These ellipticities may also be too large to be explained by warm DM, but are consistent with galaxy-sized halos formed in the Lambda-CDM paradigm.},

We propose that the conflict can be resolved if the cold dark matter particles are self-interacting with a large scattering cross-section but negligible annihilation or dissipation. In this scenario, astronomical observations may enable us to study dark matter properties that are inaccessible in the laboratory},

We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter.},

We analyze models where the dark matter is a fermion or scalar interacting with quarks and/or gluons through an effective theory containing higher dimensional operators which represent heavier states that have been integrated out of the effective field theory. We determine bounds from existing Tevatron searches for monojets as well as expected LHC reaches for a discovery. We find that colliders can provide information which is complementary or in some cases even superior to experiments searching for direct detection of dark matter through its scattering with nuclei. In particular, both the Tevatron and the LHC can outperform spin dependent searches by an order of magnitude or better over much of parameter space, and if the dark matter couples mainly to gluons, the LHC can place bounds superior to any spin independent search.},

We show that combining data from experiments using different targets can improve the dark matter discovery potential due to target complementarity. We find that in the context of spin-dependent interactions, combining results from several targets can greatly enhance the subtraction of the neutrino background for WIMP masses below 10 GeV/c\$\^2\$ and therefore probe dark matter models to lower cross-sections. In the context of target complementarity, we also explore how one can tune the relative exposures of different target materials to optimize the WIMP discovery potential.},

  abstract = {The axion emerges in extensions of the Standard Model that explain the absence of CP violation in the strong interactions. Simultaneously, it can provide naturally the cold dark matter in our universe. Several searches for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have constrained the corresponding parameter space over the last decades but no unambiguous hints of their existence have been found. The axion mass range below 1 meV remains highly attractive and a well motivated region for dark matter axions. In this White Paper we present a description of a new experiment based on the concept of a dielectric haloscope for the direct search of dark matter axions in the mass range of 40 to 400 µeV. This MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) will consist of several parallel dielectric disks, which are placed in a strong magnetic field and with adjustable separations. This setting is expected to allow for an observable emission of axion induced electromagnetic waves at a frequency between 10 to 100 GHz corresponding to the axion mass.},

  abstract      = {We report a new search of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) using the combined low background data sets in 2016 and 2017 from the PandaX-II experiment in China. The latest data set contains a new exposure of 77.1 live day, with the background reduced to a level of 0.8\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-3\}\$ evt/kg/day, improved by a factor of 2.5 in comparison to the previous run in 2016. No excess events were found above the expected background. With a total exposure of 5.4\$\textbackslash times10\^4\$ kg day, the most stringent upper limit on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section was set for a WIMP with mass larger than 100 GeV/c\$\^2\$, with the lowest exclusion at 8.6\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-47\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ at 40 GeV/c\$\^2\$.},

  abstract      = {DEAP-3600 is a single-phase liquid argon (LAr) direct-detection dark matter experiment, operating 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3279 kg of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. This paper reports on the analysis of a 758 tonne\textbackslash cdot day exposure taken over a period of 231 live-days during the first year of operation. No candidate signal events are observed in the WIMP-search region of interest, which results in the leading limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section on a LAr target of \$3.9\textbackslash times10\^\{-45\}\$ cm\$\^\{2\}\$ (\$1.5\textbackslash times10\^\{-44\}\$ cm\$\^\{2\}\$) for a 100 GeV/c\$\^\{2\}\$ (1 TeV/c\$\^\{2\}\$) WIMP mass at 90\textbackslash\% C. L. In addition to a detailed background model, this analysis demonstrates the best pulse-shape discrimination in LAr at threshold, employs a Bayesian photoelectron-counting technique to improve the energy resolution and discrimination efficiency, and utilizes two position reconstruction algorithms based on PMT charge and photon arrival times.},

The COSINE-100 experiment, consisting of 106 kg of tallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) target material, is aimed at testing DAMA's claim of dark matter observation using the same NaI(Tl) detectors. Improved event selection requirements, a more precise understanding of the detector background and the use of a larger data set considerably enhances the COSINE-100 sensitivity for dark matter detection. No signal consistent with the dark matter interaction is identified, and rules out model-dependent dark matter interpretations of the DAMA signals in the specific context of standard halo model with the same NaI(Tl) target for various interaction hypotheses.},

With the current stage, CRESST-III, we focus on a low energy threshold for increased sensitivity towards light dark matter particles. In this manuscript we describe the analysis of one detector operated in the first run of CRESST-III (05/2016-02/2018) achieving a nuclear recoil threshold of 30.1eV. This result was obtained with a 23.6g CaWO\$\_4\$ crystal operated as a cryogenic scintillating calorimeter in the CRESST setup at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). Both the primary phonon/heat signal and the simultaneously emitted scintillation light, which is absorbed in a separate silicon-on-sapphire light absorber, are measured with highly sensitive transition edge sensors operated at \textasciitilde 15mK. The unique combination of these sensors with the light element oxygen present in our target yields sensitivity to dark matter particle masses as low as 160MeV/c\$\^2\$.},

  abstract     = {The DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation data, which may be interpreted as a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (WIMPs) in our galactic halo, are examined in light of null results from other experiments. We use the energy spectrum of the combined DAMA modulation data given in 36 bins, and include the effect of channeling. Several statistical tools are implemented in our study: likelihood ratio with a global fit and with raster scans in the WIMP mass and goodness-of-fit (g.o.f.). These approaches allow us to differentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.) parameter regions. It is hard to find WIMP masses and couplings consistent with all existing data sets. For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit DAMA regions are ruled out to the 3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ C.L., even with channeling taken into account. However, for WIMP masses of \textasciitilde 8 GeV some parameters outside these regions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are compatible with all 90\% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when channeling is included. For spin-dependent (SD) interactions with proton-only couplings, a range of masses below 10 GeV is compatible with DAMA and other experiments, with and without channeling, when SuperK indirect detection constraints are included; without the SuperK constraints, masses as high as \textasciitilde 20 GeV are compatible. For SD neutron-only couplings we find no parameters compatible with all the experiments. Mixed SD couplings are examined: e.g. \textasciitilde 8 GeV mass WIMPs with a\_n = +/- a\_p are found to be consistent with all experiments. In short, there are surviving regions at low mass for both SI and SD interactions; if indirect detection limits are relaxed, some SD proton-only couplings at high masses also survive.},

We report on the final results of this experiment which includes for the first time the complete data set and improved analysis techniques including \textbackslash mbox\{acoustic\} localization to allow fiducialization and removal of higher activity regions within the detectors. No signal consistent with dark matter was observed. We set limits for spin-dependent interactions on protons of \$\textbackslash sigma\_p\^\{SD\}\$\textasciitilde =\textasciitilde 1.32\textasciitilde\$\textbackslash times\$\textasciitilde 10\$\^\{-2\}\$\textasciitilde pb (90\textbackslash\%\textasciitilde C.L.) at a WIMP mass of 20 GeV/c\$\^\{2\}\$.

The pioneering efforts of the PICASSO experiment have paved the way forward for a next generation detector incorporating much of this technology and experience into larger mass bubble chambers.},

The chamber was operated at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 1.2 keV without loss of stability. A new blind 1404-kg-day exposure at 2.45 keV threshold was acquired with approximately the same expected total background rate as the previous 1167-kg-day exposure at 3.3 keV. This increased exposure is enabled in part by a new optical tracking analysis to better identify events near detector walls, permitting a larger fiducial volume. These results set the most stringent direct-detection constraint to date on the WIMP-proton spin-dependent cross section at 2.5 \$\textbackslash times\$ 10\$\^\{-41\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for a 25 GeV WIMP, and improve on previous PICO results for 3-5 GeV WIMPs by an order of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The neutrino floor is a theoretical lower limit on WIMP-like dark matter models that are discoverable in direct detection experiments. It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for some time that the neutrino floor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufficient statistics. As a consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the "neutrino fog" instead. The downside of current methods of deriving the neutrino floor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and energy threshold. Here we propose to define the neutrino floor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino floor that is only influenced by the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux normalisations. Our floor is broadly similar to those found in the literature, but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20\textasciitilde GeV.},

Even if one could eliminate all other backgrounds, this "neutrino floor" will limit future experiments with projected sensitivities to cross-sections as small as 10\^(-48) cm\^2. Direction-sensitive detectors have the potential to study dark matter beyond the neutrino bound by fitting event distributions in multiple dimensions: recoil kinetic energy, recoil track angle with respect to the sun, and event time. This work quantitatively explores the impact of direction-sensitivity on the neutrino bound in dark matter direct detection.},

Both track and cascade events are considered in our analysis. By fixing the dark matter annihilation cross section συ at some nominal values, we study the sensitivity of IceCube/DeepCore detector to dark matter spin-independent cross section σpSI for mχ ranging from few tens of GeV to 10 TeV. This sensitivity is compared with the existing IceCube 79-string constraint on the same cross section, which was obtained by searching for dark matter annihilations in the Sun. We compare this sensitivity to dark matter direct detection results as well, in particular the XENON100 (2012) limit and the parameter regions preferred by DAMA and CRESST-II experiments. We also present IceCube/DeepCore sensitivity to συ as a function of mχ by fixing σpSI at XENON100 (2012) and XENON1T limits, respectively. This sensitivity is compared with the preferred dark matter parameter range derived from the combined fitting to PAMELA and AMS02 positron fraction data. We conclude that the search for dark matter annihilations in the Earth core provides competitive constraints on σpSI and συ in the case of low-mass dark matter. Particularly, the expected constraint on σpSI for 5 years of data taking in IceCube/DeepCore is more stringent than the current IceCube 79-string limit mentioned above.},

The main improvements relative to previous works are our use of 5.8 years of data reprocessed with the Pass 8 event-level analysis and the additional data resulting from the modified observing strategy designed to increase exposure of the Galactic center region. We searched in five sky regions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically-motivated dark matter scenarios and find no significant detections.

In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ \$\textbackslash sim\$ 200-GeV/\$c\^2\$) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton cross section for WIMP masses below 200 GeV/\$c\^2\$ (at 10 GeV/\$c\^2\$, 1.49\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-39\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow b \textbackslash bar\{b\}\$ and 1.31\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-40\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash tau\^+\textbackslash tau\^-\$ annihilation channels), also ruling out some fraction of WIMP candidates with spin-independent (SI) coupling in the few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ mass range.},

This naturally occurs if the mean free path of the mediator is in excess of the solar (or planetary) radius. We show that existing constraints from water Cerenkov detectors already provide a novel probe of the parameter space of these models, complementary to other sources, with significant scope for future improvement from high angular resolution gamma-ray telescopes such as Fermi-LAT. Fluxes of charged particles produced in mediator decays are also capable of contributing a significant solar system component to the spectrum of energetic electrons and positrons, a possibility which can be tested with the directional and timing information of PAMELA and Fermi.},

In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into metastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles. If the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar core before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In the standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of the Sun, absorption is relevant for E {$>$} 100 GeV, resulting in a significant suppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E \textasciitilde{} 1 TeV. In the secluded dark matter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are injected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls exponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on the neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar radius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy, this enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have a large effect on overall event rates.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter may interact with the Standard Model through the kinetic mixing of dark photons, \$A'\$, with Standard Model photons. Such dark matter will accumulate in the Sun and annihilate into dark photons. The dark photons may then leave the Sun and decay into pairs of charged Standard Model particles that can be detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The directionality of this "dark sunshine" is distinct from all astrophysical backgrounds, providing an opportunity for unambiguous dark matter discovery by AMS. We perform a complete analysis of this scenario including Sommerfeld enhancements of dark matter annihilation and the effect of the Sun's magnetic field on the signal, and we define a set of cuts to optimize the signal probability. With the three years of data already collected, AMS may discover dark matter with mass 1 TeV \$\textbackslash lesssim m\_X \textbackslash lesssim\$ 10 TeV, dark photon masses \$m\_\{A'\} \textbackslash sim \textbackslash mathcal O(100)\$ MeV, and kinetic mixing parameters \$10\^\{-10\} \textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{-8\}\$. The proposed search extends beyond existing beam dump and supernova bounds, and it is complementary to direct detection, probing the same region of parameter space for elastic dark matter, but potentially far more in the case of inelastic dark matter.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter charged under a new gauge sector, as motivated by recent data, suggests a rich GeV-scale "dark sector" weakly coupled to the Standard Model by gauge kinetic mixing. The new gauge bosons can decay to Standard Model leptons, but this mode is suppressed if decays into lighter dark sector particles are kinematically allowed. These particles in turn typically have macroscopic decay lifetimes that are constrained by two classes of experiments, which we discuss. Lifetimes of 10 cm {$<$} c tau {$<$} 10\^8 cm are constrained by existing terrestrial beam-dump experiments. If, in addition, dark matter captured in the Sun (or Earth) annihilates into these particles, lifetimes up to 10\^15 cm are constrained by solar observations. These bounds span fourteen orders of magnitude in lifetime, but they are not exhaustive. Accordingly, we identify promising new directions for experiments including searches for displaced di-muons in B-factories, studies at high-energy and -intensity proton beam dumps, precision gamma-ray and electronic measurements of the Sun, and milli-charge searches re-analyzed in this new context.},

For gamma rays, there are exciting new opportunities, due to detailed measurements of GeV solar gamma rays with Fermi, and unprecedented sensitivities in the TeV range with HAWC and LHAASO. For neutrinos, the enhanced flux, particularly at higher energies (\$\textbackslash sim\$TeV), allows a more sensitive dark matter search with IceCube and KM3NeT. We show that these search channels can be extremely powerful, potentially improving sensitivity to the dark matter spin-dependent scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude relative to present searches for high-energy solar neutrinos, as well as direct detection experiments.},

Conventional solutions require additional mechanisms for energy transport within the Sun. Vincent et al. have recently suggested that dark matter with a momentum or velocity dependent cross section could provide a solution. In this work, we consider three models of dark matter with such cross sections and their effect on the stellar structure. In particular, the three models incorporate dark matter particles interacting through an electromagnetic dipole moment: an electric dipole, a magnetic dipole or an anapole. Each model is implemented in the \textbackslash texttt\{DarkStec\} stellar evolution program, which incorporates the effects of dark matter capture and heat transport within the solar interior. We show that dark matter with an anapole moment of \$\textbackslash sim1\textbackslash mathrm\{GeV\}\^\{-2\}\$ or magnetic dipole moment of \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{-3\}\textbackslash mu\_p\$ can improve the sound-speed profile, small frequency separations and convective zone radius with respect to the Standard Solar Model. However, the required dipole moments are strongly excluded by direct detection experiments.},

We find that a \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^\{-2\}\$ dependence can significantly enhance energy transport from the inner solar core to the outer core. The same can true for any \$q\$-dependent coupling, if the dark matter mass lies within some specific range for each coupling. This effect can complement direct searches for dark matter; combining these results with state-of-the-art Solar simulations should greatly increase sensitivity to certain DM models. It also seems possible that the so-called Solar Abundance Problem could be resolved by enhanced energy transport in the solar core due to such velocity- or momentum-dependent scatterings.},

This analysis uses data gathered in the austral winters between May 2011 and May 2014, corresponding to 532 days of livetime when the Sun, being below the horizon, is a source of up-going neutrino events, easiest to discriminate against the dominant background of atmospheric muons. The sensitivity is a factor of two to four better than previous searches due to additional statistics and improved analysis methods involving better background rejection and reconstructions.

However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

From the observation of old NS, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric DM. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of DM particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the DM density and energy profiles inside the NS, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, DM thermalizes with NS material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the DM-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of DM particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the DM-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic DM models; and (e) the use of realistic NS equations of state in determining these constraints.},

  abstract     = {We calculate the number of dark matter particles that a neutron star accumulates over its lifetime as it rotates around the center of a galaxy, when the dark matter particle is a self-interacting boson but does not self-annihilate. We take into account dark matter interactions with baryonic matter and the time evolution of the dark matter sphere as it collapses within the neutron star. We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions. We show that for a dark matter density of \$\textasciitilde 10\^3\$ GeV/cm\$\^3\$ and dark matter mass \$m\_\textbackslash chi\$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for high dark matter density regions, we find that for \$m\_\textbackslash chi\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV when the dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-52\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ to \$10\^\{-57\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, the dark matter self-interaction cross section limit is \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\}{$<$} 10\^\{-33\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.},

Since dark matter does not self-annihilate in the ADM scenario, dark matter accumulates in neutron stars, eventually reaching the Chandrasekhar limit and forming a black hole. We focus on the case of scalar ADM, where the constraints from Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent black hole formation are most severe due to the absence of Fermi degeneracy pressure. We also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space, non-trivial effects from Hawking radiation can modify our limits. We find that for scalar ADM with mass between 100 keV and 10\^5 GeV, the constraint from pulsars in globular clusters on the scattering cross-section with neutrons ranges from \textbackslash sigma\_n {$<$} 10\^\{-45\} cm\^2 to 10\^\{-52\} cm\vphantom\{\}\^2. In particular, for scalar ADM with mass between 1 GeV and 1 TeV (in the case where black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation is unimportant), the constraint on the scattering cross-section is below what is reachable with ton scale direct detection experiments.},

First, NS-imploding dark matter forms \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-10\}\$ solar mass or smaller black holes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers seen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae seen by telescopes like DES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of "black mergers" containing \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced neutron star implosions may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a detectable, accompanying gravitational signal, which we call "quiet kilonovae." Using DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain quiet kilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and quiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding dark matter destroys most neutron stars at the centers of disc galaxies, so that neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut at large radii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located to \$\textbackslash sim\$1 kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron star implosions at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon cross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current direct detection experimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast radio bursts can be tested at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence once 20 bursts are located in host galaxies by radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.},

We focus on models of dark matter interacting by the exchange of light vector gauge bosons that couple to a conserved dark charge. In these models, dark matter accumulated in neutron stars can extend to large radii and enhance their tidal polarizability. Gravitational waves detected from the first binary neutron star merger GW170817 places useful constraints on such not-so compact objects.

  abstract     = {White dwarfs (WDs) are the most promising captors of dark matter (DM) particles in the crests that are expected to build up in the cores of dense stellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores to liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with our Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects, makes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the DM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to us and not heavily extincted, such as \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen, we may be able to detect DM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in a stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at the centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate of WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would emit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation \$N-\$body simulations of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in the range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS observations of stars in the center of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen to search for DM burning WDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of crowding and incompleteness, we proof that their bunching up at high luminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a truncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM burning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular clusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different models of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle scattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs really exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of IMBHs.},

Dark matter particles which scatter inelastically with nuclei (such that they reconcile the annual modulation reported by DAMA with the null results of CDMS and other experiments), however, can be captured by and annihilate in compact stars at a much higher rate. As a result, old white dwarf stars residing in high dark matter density environments can be prevented from cooling below several thousand degrees Kelvin. Observations of old, cool white dwarfs in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, or in the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way, can thus potentially provide a valuable test of the inelastic dark matter hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {We consider the capture of inelastic dark matter in white dwarves by inelastic spin-independent scattering on nuclei. We show that if the dark matter annihilates to standard-model particles then, under the assumption of primordial globular cluster formation, the observation of cold white dwarves in the globular cluster M4 appears inconsistent with explanations of the observed DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal based on spin-independent inelastic dark matter scattering. Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo. Finally we argue that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to other direct and indirect detection searches.},

Our results cover the parameter space corresponding to relatively light dark matter particles, in the mass range \$0.1\textasciitilde GeV-5\textasciitilde GeV\$, which is known to be very difficult to be probed by direct dark matter searches. The additional luminosity coming from self-annihilations of dark matter particles captured inside the stars must not exceed the observed luminosity. Imposing that condition, we obtain for the spin independent cross section of light dark matter particles on baryons \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{N\textbackslash chi\}\$ the upper bound: \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{N\textbackslash chi\} {$<$} 4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-41\}\{\textbackslash rm cm\^2\}\$.},

  abstract     = {We identify a largely model-independent signature of dark matter interactions with nucleons and electrons. Dark matter in the local galactic halo, gravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against and deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared blackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European Extremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from neutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic center, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark matter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding \$2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-45\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For lighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with dark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter, it scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for capture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could determine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron stars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur in relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like pure Higgsinos can also be discovered.},
