These detectors can also study neutrinos through neutrinoless double-beta decay and through a variety of astrophysical sources. A next-generation xenon-based detector will therefore be a true multi-purpose observatory to significantly advance particle physics, nuclear physics, astrophysics, solar physics, and cosmology. This review article presents the science cases for such a detector.},

Our measurement stands in the long history of EDM experiments probing physics violating time reversal invariance. The salient features of this experiment were the use of a Hg-199 co-magnetometer and an array of optically pumped cesium vapor magnetometers to cancel and correct for magnetic field changes. The statistical analysis was performed on blinded datasets by two separate groups while the estimation of systematic effects profited from an unprecedented knowledge of the magnetic field. The measured value of the neutron EDM is \$d\_\{\textbackslash rm n\} = (0.0\textbackslash pm1.1\_\{\textbackslash rm stat\}\textbackslash pm0.2\_\{\textbackslash rm sys\})\textbackslash times10\^\{-26\}e\textbackslash,\{\textbackslash rm cm\}\$.},

  abstract     = {White dwarfs (WDs) are the most promising captors of dark matter (DM) particles in the crests that are expected to build up in the cores of dense stellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores to liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with our Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects, makes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the DM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to us and not heavily extincted, such as \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen, we may be able to detect DM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in a stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at the centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate of WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would emit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation \$N-\$body simulations of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in the range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS observations of stars in the center of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen to search for DM burning WDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of crowding and incompleteness, we proof that their bunching up at high luminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a truncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM burning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular clusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different models of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle scattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs really exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of IMBHs.},

  abstract     = {We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.},

  abstract     = {We identify a largely model-independent signature of dark matter interactions with nucleons and electrons. Dark matter in the local galactic halo, gravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against and deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared blackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European Extremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from neutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic center, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark matter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding \$2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-45\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For lighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with dark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter, it scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for capture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could determine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron stars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur in relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like pure Higgsinos can also be discovered.},

This naturally occurs if the mean free path of the mediator is in excess of the solar (or planetary) radius. We show that existing constraints from water Cerenkov detectors already provide a novel probe of the parameter space of these models, complementary to other sources, with significant scope for future improvement from high angular resolution gamma-ray telescopes such as Fermi-LAT. Fluxes of charged particles produced in mediator decays are also capable of contributing a significant solar system component to the spectrum of energetic electrons and positrons, a possibility which can be tested with the directional and timing information of PAMELA and Fermi.},

  abstract     = {We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M\_sun. We emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.},

In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into metastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles. If the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar core before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In the standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of the Sun, absorption is relevant for E {$>$} 100 GeV, resulting in a significant suppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E \textasciitilde{} 1 TeV. In the secluded dark matter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are injected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls exponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on the neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar radius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy, this enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have a large effect on overall event rates.},

If non-annihilating dark matter is captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

Dark matter can be captured by neutron stars via scattering, where kinetic energy is transferred to the star. This can have a number of observational consequences, such as the heating of old neutron stars to infra-red temperatures. Previous treatments of the capture process have employed various approximation or simplifications. We present here an improved treatment of dark matter capture, valid for a wide dark matter mass range, that correctly incorporates all relevant physical effects. These include gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli blocking, neutron star opacity and multi-scattering effects. We provide general expressions that enable the exact capture rate to be calculated numerically, and derive simplified expressions that are valid for particular interaction types or mass regimes and that greatly increase the computational efficiency. Our formalism is applicable to the scattering of dark matter from any neutron star constituents, or to the capture of dark matter in other compact objects.},

We recently developed an improved treatment of dark matter (DM) capture in neutron stars that properly incorporates many of the important physical effects, and outlined useful analytic approximations that are valid when the scattering amplitude is independent of the centre of mass energy. We now extend that analysis to all interaction types. We also discuss the effect of going beyond the zero-temperature approximation, which provides a boost to the capture rate of low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter from leptonic targets, for which a correct relativistic description is essential. We find that the potential neutron star sensitivity to DM-lepton scattering cross sections greatly exceeds electron-recoil experiments, particularly in the sub-GeV regime, with a sensitivity to sub-MeV DM well beyond the reach of future terrestrial experiments.},

Properly incorporating these effects is found to suppress the dark matter capture rate by up to four orders of magnitude for the heaviest stars.},

  abstract     = {White dwarfs, the most abundant stellar remnants, provide a promising means of probing dark matter (DM) interactions, complimentary to terrestrial searches. The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to gravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In particular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark matter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of captured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on either the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions, we account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form factors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects pertinent to sub-GeV dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic, degenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple scattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter evaporation rate. The DM-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be constrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with observations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply this technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster Messier 4, which we assume to be located in a DM subhalo. For DM-nucleon scattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-GeV mass range inaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only by either evaporation or dominant DM annihilation to neutrinos, and can be competitive with direct detection in the \$1-10\^4\$ GeV range. White dwarf limits on dark matter-electron scattering are found to outperform current electron recoil experiments over the full mass range considered, and extend well beyond the \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV mass regime where the sensitivity of electron recoil experiments is reduced.},

In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than \$1\$ year for vector interactions and \$10\^4\$ years for scalar interactions.},

We find that Pauli blocking, kinematic constraints, and superfluidity and superconductivity in the neutron star significantly affect the DM thermalization time, in general lengthening it. This could change the final DM mass and DM-nucleon cross section constraints by considering black hole formation in neutron stars due to DM accretion. We consider the class of models in which DM is an asymmetric, complex scalar particle with a mass between 1 keV and 5 GeV which couples to regular matter via some heavy vector boson. Interestingly, we find that the discovery of asymmetric, bosonic DM could motivate the existence of exotic neutron star cores. We apply our results to the case of mixed sneutrino DM.},

First, NS-imploding dark matter forms \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-10\}\$ solar mass or smaller black holes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers seen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae seen by telescopes like DES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of "black mergers" containing \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced neutron star implosions may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a detectable, accompanying gravitational signal, which we call "quiet kilonovae." Using DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain quiet kilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and quiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding dark matter destroys most neutron stars at the centers of disc galaxies, so that neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut at large radii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located to \$\textbackslash sim\$1 kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron star implosions at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon cross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current direct detection experimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast radio bursts can be tested at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence once 20 bursts are located in host galaxies by radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.},

  abstract     = {White dwarfs and neutron stars are far-reaching and multi-faceted laboratories in the hunt for dark matter. We review detection prospects of wave-like, particulate, macroscopic and black hole dark matter that make use of several exceptional properties of compact stars, such as ultra-high densities, deep fermion degeneracies, low temperatures, nucleon superfluidity, strong magnetic fields, high rotational regularity, and significant gravitational wave emissivity. Foundational topics first made explicit in this document include the effect of the ``propellor phase" on neutron star baryonic accretion, and the contribution of Auger and Cooper pair breaking effects to neutron star heating by dark matter capture.},

  abstract     = {Recent inference results of the sound velocity in the cores of neutron stars are summarized. Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars, the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example, a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities \$c\_s\^2 {$>$} 0.1\$ in the cores of 2.1 solar-mass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak first-order phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash rho/\textbackslash rho {$<$} 0.2\$ (at 68\% level) in a Maxwell construction turn out to be still possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter. In view of these data-based constraints, much discussed issues such as the quest for a phase transition towards restored chiral symmetry, and the active degrees of freedom in cold and dense baryonic matter, are reexamined.},

However, for all values of m\_DM in these theories, the mediator width is larger than the mass, so that a particle-like interpretation of the mediator is doubtful. Furthermore, consistency with the thermal relic density occurs only for 170},

  abstract     = {(Abridged) We present an analysis of a Chandra ACIS-S observation of the elliptical galaxy NGC 720 to verify the existence of a dark matter (DM) halo and to measure its ellipticity. The ACIS-S3 image reveals over 60 point sources. For semi-major axes a{$<$}\textasciitilde 150 (18.2h\_\{70\}\^\{-1\} kpc) the ellipticity of the diffuse emission is ex \textasciitilde 0.15, which is less than the values 0.2-0.3 obtained from ROSAT because the point sources contaminated the ROSAT values. The Chandra data confirm the \textasciitilde 20 deg position angle (PA) twist discovered by ROSAT, but the Chandra twist is more gradual also because of the point sources contaminating the ROSAT values. Overall the ex and PA values for a{$<$}\textasciitilde 150 can be explained by the triaxial model of NGC 720 published by Romanowsky \& Kochanek. Since the optical image displays no substantial isophote twisting, the X-ray PA twist requires a massive DM halo if the hot gas is in hydrostatic equilibrium. The mass-follows-light hypothesis is also inconsistent with the Chandra ellipticities at the 96\% (98\%) level for oblate (prolate) symmetry. Thus, both the PA twist and the ellipticities of the Chandra image imply a DM halo independent of the gas T profile -- evidence that cannot be obviated by alternative gravity theories such as MOND. The DM density model, rho \textasciitilde a\^\{-2\}, provides the best fit and gives ellipticities of 0.37 +/- 0.03 (0.36 +/- 0.02) for oblate (prolate) models. These moderate ellipticities for the DM halo are inconsistent with both the nearly spherical halos predicted if the DM is self-interacting and with the highly flattened halos predicted if the DM is cold molecular gas. These ellipticities may also be too large to be explained by warm DM, but are consistent with galaxy-sized halos formed in the Lambda-CDM paradigm.},

  abstract     = {We generalize in several directions our recent analysis of the limitations to the use of the effective field theory approach to study dark matter at the LHC. Firstly, we study the full list of operators connecting fermion DM to quarks and gluons, corresponding to integrating out a heavy mediator in the \$s\$-channel; secondly, we provide analytical results for the validity of the EFT description for both \$\textbackslash sqrt\{s\}=8\$ \{\textbackslash rm TeV\} and \$14\$ \{\textbackslash rm TeV\}; thirdly, we make use of a MonteCarlo event generator approach to assess the validity of our analytical conclusions. We apply our results to revisit the current collider bounds on the ultraviolet cut-off scale of the effective field theory and show that these bounds are weakened once the validity conditions of the effective field theory are imposed.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter with momentum- or velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei has shown significant promise for explaining the so-called Solar Abundance Problem, a longstanding discrepancy between solar spectroscopy and helioseismology. The best-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5 GeV. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun can be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of such models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the first time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions, thermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically thin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that depending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass below which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 GeV. This has the effect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance Problem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also provide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account thermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly matched to the well-known saturation limit.},

Accretion of particle dark matter (DM) by such NS can heat them up through kinetic and annihilation processes. This increases the NS surface temperature to a maximum of \$\textbackslash sim 2550\$ K in the best case scenario. The maximum accretion rate depends on the DM ambient density and velocity dispersion, and on the NS equation of state and their velocity distributions. Upon scanning over these variables, we find that the effective surface temperature varies at most by \$\textbackslash sim 40\textbackslash\%\$. Black body spectrum of such warm NS peak at near infrared wavelengths with magnitudes in the range potentially detectable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the JWST exposure time calculator, we demonstrate that NS with surface temperatures \$\textbackslash gtrsim 2400\$ K, located at a distance of 10 pc can be detected through the F150W2 (F322W2) filters of the NIRCAM instrument at SNR \$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\$ (5) within 24 hours of exposure time. Independently of DM, an observation of NS with surface temperatures \$\textbackslash gtrsim 2500\$ K will be a formative step towards testing the minimal cooling paradigm during late evolutionary stages.},

  abstract     = {We introduce dark matter (DM) evolution process in the Sun under a two-component DM (2DM) scenario. Both DM species \$\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\$ with masses heavier than 1 GeV are considered. In this picture, both species could be captured by the Sun through DM-nucleus scattering and DM self-scatterings, e.g. \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\textbackslash xi\$ collisions. In addition, the heterogeneous self-scattering due to \$\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\$ collision is essentially possible in any 2DM models. This new introduced scattering naturally weaves the evolution processes of the two DM species that was assumed to evolve independently. Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of DM being captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range of DM mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the solar-captured DM annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the DM indirect detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution in the Sun as well as its kinematics are studied.},

We study the effect of self-interacting DM (SIDM) captured by nearby NS that can reheat it to an appreciated surface temperature through absorbing the energy released due to DM annihilation. When DM-nucleon cross section \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\$ is small enough, DM self-interaction will take over the capture process and make the number of captured DM particles increased as well as the DM annihilation rate. The corresponding NS surface temperature resulted from DM self-interaction is about hundreds of Kelvin and is potentially detectable by the future infrared telescopes. Such observations could act as the complementary probe on DM properties to the current DM direct searches.},

  abstract      = {A search for dark matter particles is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum, at least one energetic jet, and no leptons, in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse femtobarns. The search includes events with jets from the hadronic decays of a W or Z boson. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted background contributions from standard model processes. The results are presented in terms of simplified models in which dark matter particles are produced through interactions involving a vector, axial-vector, scalar, or pseudoscalar mediator. Vector and axial-vector mediator particles with masses up to 1.95 TeV, and scalar and pseudoscalar mediator particles with masses up to 100 and 430 GeV respectively, are excluded at 95\% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of the invisible decays of the Higgs boson, yielding an observed (expected) 95\% confidence level upper limit of 0.44 (0.56) on the corresponding branching fraction. The results of this search provide the strongest constraints on the dark matter pair production cross section through vector and axial-vector mediators at a particle collider. When compared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and 550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. The search yields stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 200 GeV, assuming a pseudoscalar mediator, when compared to the indirect detection results from Fermi-LAT.},

The COSINE-100 experiment, consisting of 106 kg of tallium-doped sodium iodide (NaI(Tl)) target material, is aimed at testing DAMA's claim of dark matter observation using the same NaI(Tl) detectors. Improved event selection requirements, a more precise understanding of the detector background and the use of a larger data set considerably enhances the COSINE-100 sensitivity for dark matter detection. No signal consistent with the dark matter interaction is identified, and rules out model-dependent dark matter interpretations of the DAMA signals in the specific context of standard halo model with the same NaI(Tl) target for various interaction hypotheses.},

With the current stage, CRESST-III, we focus on a low energy threshold for increased sensitivity towards light dark matter particles. In this manuscript we describe the analysis of one detector operated in the first run of CRESST-III (05/2016-02/2018) achieving a nuclear recoil threshold of 30.1eV. This result was obtained with a 23.6g CaWO\$\_4\$ crystal operated as a cryogenic scintillating calorimeter in the CRESST setup at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso (LNGS). Both the primary phonon/heat signal and the simultaneously emitted scintillation light, which is absorbed in a separate silicon-on-sapphire light absorber, are measured with highly sensitive transition edge sensors operated at \textasciitilde 15mK. The unique combination of these sensors with the light element oxygen present in our target yields sensitivity to dark matter particle masses as low as 160MeV/c\$\^2\$.},

We present new constraints for sub-GeV/c\$\^2\$ dark matter using the dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber of the DarkSide-50 experiment with an exposure of (12306 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 184) kg d. The analysis is based on the ionization signal alone and significantly enhances the sensitivity of DarkSide-50, enabling sensitivity to dark matter with masses down to 40 MeV/c\$\^2\$.

  abstract      = {DEAP-3600 is a single-phase liquid argon (LAr) direct-detection dark matter experiment, operating 2 km underground at SNOLAB (Sudbury, Canada). The detector consists of 3279 kg of LAr contained in a spherical acrylic vessel. This paper reports on the analysis of a 758 tonne\textbackslash cdot day exposure taken over a period of 231 live-days during the first year of operation. No candidate signal events are observed in the WIMP-search region of interest, which results in the leading limit on the WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section on a LAr target of \$3.9\textbackslash times10\^\{-45\}\$ cm\$\^\{2\}\$ (\$1.5\textbackslash times10\^\{-44\}\$ cm\$\^\{2\}\$) for a 100 GeV/c\$\^\{2\}\$ (1 TeV/c\$\^\{2\}\$) WIMP mass at 90\textbackslash\% C. L. In addition to a detailed background model, this analysis demonstrates the best pulse-shape discrimination in LAr at threshold, employs a Bayesian photoelectron-counting technique to improve the energy resolution and discrimination efficiency, and utilizes two position reconstruction algorithms based on PMT charge and photon arrival times.},

In particular, our calculations indicate that the presence of a DM core with a mass fraction \$\textbackslash sim 5\textbackslash\%\$ could affect significantly the interpretation of these NS data as constraints on the nuclear equation of state (EOS), potentially excluding some EOS models on the basis of the measured mass of PSR J0348+0432, while allowing other EOS models to become consistent with the LIGO/Virgo upper limit on \$\textbackslash Lambda\$.

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. We then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including WIMPs, superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, we critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

Such dark matter will accumulate in the Sun and annihilate into dark photons. The dark photons may then leave the Sun and decay into pairs of charged Standard Model particles that can be detected by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer. The directionality of this "dark sunshine" is distinct from all astrophysical backgrounds, providing an opportunity for unambiguous dark matter discovery by AMS. We perform a complete analysis of this scenario including Sommerfeld enhancements of dark matter annihilation and the effect of the Sun's magnetic field on the signal, and we define a set of cuts to optimize the signal probability. With the three years of data already collected, AMS may discover dark matter with mass 1 TeV \$\textbackslash lesssim m\_X \textbackslash lesssim\$ 10 TeV, dark photon masses \$m\_\{A'\} \textbackslash sim \textbackslash mathcal O(100)\$ MeV, and kinetic mixing parameters \$10\^\{-10\} \textbackslash lesssim \textbackslash varepsilon \textbackslash lesssim 10\^\{-8\}\$. The proposed search extends beyond existing beam dump and supernova bounds, and it is complementary to direct detection, probing the same region of parameter space for elastic dark matter, but potentially far more in the case of inelastic dark matter.},

  abstract      = {Dark matter in the Milky Way may annihilate directly into gamma rays, producing a monoenergetic spectral line. Therefore, detecting such a signature would be strong evidence for dark matter annihilation or decay. We search for spectral lines in the Fermi Large Area Telescope observations of the Milky Way halo in the energy range 200 MeV to 500 GeV using analysis methods from our most recent line searches. The main improvements relative to previous works are our use of 5.8 years of data reprocessed with the Pass 8 event-level analysis and the additional data resulting from the modified observing strategy designed to increase exposure of the Galactic center region. We searched in five sky regions selected to optimize sensitivity to different theoretically-motivated dark matter scenarios and find no significant detections. In addition to presenting the results from our search for lines, we also investigate the previously reported tentative detection of a line at 133 GeV using the new Pass 8 data.},

  abstract     = {We extend and explore the general non-relativistic effective theory of dark matter (DM) direct detection. We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter.},

  abstract     = {If dark matter has a sizable scattering cross section with nucleons, it can efficiently be captured by a neutron star. Its energy is then transferred to the neutron star as heat through the scattering and annihilation inside the star. This heating effect may be detectable via dedicated temperature observations of nearby old pulsars, providing an alternative method for dark matter searches. In this paper, we show that for electroweak multiplet dark matter this search strategy can probe the parameter region which is out of reach of future dark matter direct detection experiments. To see this systematically, we classify such dark matter candidates in terms of their electroweak charges and investigate the effect of ultraviolet physics by means of higher-dimensional effective operators. We then show that if the effect of ultraviolet physics is sizable, the dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering cross section becomes sufficiently large, whilst if it is suppressed, then the mass splittings among the components of the DM multiplet get small enough so that the inelastic scattering processes are operative. In any case, the electroweak multiplet dark matter particles are efficiently captured in neutron stars, making the search strategy with the temperature observation of old neutron stars promising.},

  abstract     = {Due to their extreme density and low temperature, neutron stars (NS) are efficient probes to unveil interactions between standard model and dark matter (DM) particles. From elastic scatterings on NS material, DM can get gravitationally trapped by the star. The cooling of DM through further collisions may lead to the formation of a dense core which could collapse into a black hole, thus destroying the whole NS. From the observation of old NS, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric DM. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of DM particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the DM density and energy profiles inside the NS, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, DM thermalizes with NS material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the DM-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of DM particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the DM-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic DM models; and (e) the use of realistic NS equations of state in determining these constraints.},

  abstract     = {Scatterings of galactic dark matter (DM) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped. DM particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range \$[10\^\{-10\} - 10\^2]\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$, for constant scattering cross sections and \$s\$-wave annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by \$E\_c/T\_\textbackslash chi \textbackslash sim 30\$, where \$E\_c\$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and \$T\_\textbackslash chi\$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm evap\} \textbackslash simeq 0.7\$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section, the DM evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range \$10\^\{-41\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2 \textbackslash leq \textbackslash sigma\_p \textbackslash leq 10\^\{-31\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2\$, where \$\textbackslash sigma\_p\$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity, or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, a revised set of solar abundances has led to a discrepancy in the sound-speed profile between helioseismology and theoretical solar models. Conventional solutions require additional mechanisms for energy transport within the Sun. Vincent et al. have recently suggested that dark matter with a momentum or velocity dependent cross section could provide a solution. In this work, we consider three models of dark matter with such cross sections and their effect on the stellar structure. In particular, the three models incorporate dark matter particles interacting through an electromagnetic dipole moment: an electric dipole, a magnetic dipole or an anapole. Each model is implemented in the \textbackslash texttt\{DarkStec\} stellar evolution program, which incorporates the effects of dark matter capture and heat transport within the solar interior. We show that dark matter with an anapole moment of \$\textbackslash sim1\textbackslash mathrm\{GeV\}\^\{-2\}\$ or magnetic dipole moment of \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{-3\}\textbackslash mu\_p\$ can improve the sound-speed profile, small frequency separations and convective zone radius with respect to the Standard Solar Model. However, the required dipole moments are strongly excluded by direct detection experiments.},

We analyze models where the dark matter is a fermion or scalar interacting with quarks and/or gluons through an effective theory containing higher dimensional operators which represent heavier states that have been integrated out of the effective field theory. We determine bounds from existing Tevatron searches for monojets as well as expected LHC reaches for a discovery. We find that colliders can provide information which is complementary or in some cases even superior to experiments searching for direct detection of dark matter through its scattering with nuclei. In particular, both the Tevatron and the LHC can outperform spin dependent searches by an order of magnitude or better over much of parameter space, and if the dark matter couples mainly to gluons, the LHC can place bounds superior to any spin independent search.},

Capture by the earth is found to be significantly enhanced whenever the WIMP mass is roughly equal to the nuclear mass of an element present in the earth in large quantities. For Dirac neutrino WIMPs of mass 10-90 GeV, the capture rate is 10-300 times that previously believed. Capture rates for the sun are also recalculated and found to be from 1.5 times higher to 3 times lower than previously believed, depending on the mass and type of WIMP. The earth alone or the earth in combination with the sun is found to give a much stronger annihilation signal from Dirac neutrino WIMPs than the sun alone over a very large mass range. This is particularly important in the neighborhood of the mass of iron where previous analyses could not set any significant limits.},

First, an analytic approximation is made by defining an appropriate truncation of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the WIMPs and calculating the exact evaporation rate from this distribution due to interaction with a truly thermal distribution of nuclei. Then, the actual (nonthermal) distribution of Dirac neutrino WIMPs in the sun is calculated numerically for WIMPs of mass 1-7 GeV. Evaporation from the actual and thermal distributions is compared. It is found that the evaporation mass for a solar lifetime is 3.7 GeV, and for an 'annihilation lifetime', 2.9 GeV. These are about 8 percent lower than the most well-reasoned previous estimate.},

By means of a Monte Carlo integration of the Boltzmann collision equation, the energy transfer for simple model stars is computed and compared with an analytic approximation previously proposed by Press and Spergel (1985). The Press-Spergel approximation overestimates the energy transfer typically by a factor of a few. This factor is a sensitive function of radius, so that it is impossible to correct for it globally.},

Even if one could eliminate all other backgrounds, this "neutrino floor" will limit future experiments with projected sensitivities to cross-sections as small as 10\^(-48) cm\^2. Direction-sensitive detectors have the potential to study dark matter beyond the neutrino bound by fitting event distributions in multiple dimensions: recoil kinetic energy, recoil track angle with respect to the sun, and event time. This work quantitatively explores the impact of direction-sensitivity on the neutrino bound in dark matter direct detection.},

We take into account dark matter interactions with baryonic matter and the time evolution of the dark matter sphere as it collapses within the neutron star. We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions. We show that for a dark matter density of \$\textasciitilde 10\^3\$ GeV/cm\$\^3\$ and dark matter mass \$m\_\textbackslash chi\$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for high dark matter density regions, we find that for \$m\_\textbackslash chi\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV when the dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-52\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ to \$10\^\{-57\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, the dark matter self-interaction cross section limit is \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\}{$<$} 10\^\{-33\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.},

  abstract     = {Equilibrium configurations of cold neutron stars near the minimum mass are studied, using the recent equation of state SLy, which describes in a unified, physically consistent manner, both the solid crust and the liquid core of neutron stars. Results are compared with those obtained using an older FPS equation of state of cold catalyzed matter. The value of M\_min\textbackslash simeq 0.09M\_sun depends very weakly on the equation of state of cold catalyzed matter: it is 0.094 M\_sun for the SLy model, and 0.088 M\_sun for the FPS one. Central density at M\_min is significantly lower than the normal nuclear density: for the SLy equation of state we get central density 1.7 10\^\{14\} g/cm\^3, to be compared with 2.3 10\^\{14\} g/cm\^3 obtained for the FPS one. Even at M\_min, neutron stars have a small liquid core of radius of about 4 km, containing some 2-3\% of the stellar mass. Neutron stars with 0.09 M\_sun},

  abstract     = {Dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles is predicted to become gravitationally captured and accumulate in stars. While the subsequent annihilations of such particles lead to the injection of energy into stellar cores, elastically scattering dark matter particles do not generally yield enough energy to observably impact stellar phenomenology. Dark matter particles which scatter inelastically with nuclei (such that they reconcile the annual modulation reported by DAMA with the null results of CDMS and other experiments), however, can be captured by and annihilate in compact stars at a much higher rate. As a result, old white dwarf stars residing in high dark matter density environments can be prevented from cooling below several thousand degrees Kelvin. Observations of old, cool white dwarfs in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, or in the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way, can thus potentially provide a valuable test of the inelastic dark matter hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

  abstract     = {Neutron stars provide a window into the properties of dense nuclear matter. Several recent observational and theoretical developments provide powerful constraints on their structure and internal composition. Among these are the first observed binary neutron star merger, GW170817, whose gravitational radiation was accompanied by electromagnetic radiation from a short {$\gamma$}-ray burst and an optical afterglow believed to be due to the radioactive decay of newly minted heavy r-process nuclei. These observations give important constraints on the radii of typical neutron stars and on the upper limit to the neutron star maximum mass and complement recent pulsar observations that established a lower limit. Pulse-profile observations by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) X-ray telescope provide an independent, consistent measure of the neutron star radius. Theoretical many-body studies of neutron matter reinforce these estimates of neutron star radii. Studies using parameterized dense matter equations of state (EOSs) reveal several EOS-independent relations connecting global neutron star properties.},

We consider the case when annihilation proceeds via long-lived dark mediators, which allows gamma rays to escape the Sun and reduces the attenuation of neutrinos. For gamma rays, there are exciting new opportunities, due to detailed measurements of GeV solar gamma rays with Fermi, and unprecedented sensitivities in the TeV range with HAWC and LHAASO. For neutrinos, the enhanced flux, particularly at higher energies (\$\textbackslash sim\$TeV), allows a more sensitive dark matter search with IceCube and KM3NeT. We show that these search channels can be extremely powerful, potentially improving sensitivity to the dark matter spin-dependent scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude relative to present searches for high-energy solar neutrinos, as well as direct detection experiments.},

We focus on annihilation modes {$\chi\chi$} {$\rightarrow$} {$\nu\nu$}\textasciimacron, {$\tau$} +{$\tau$} -, b\textasciimacron b, and W +W -. Both track and cascade events are considered in our analysis. By fixing the dark matter annihilation cross section {$\sigma\upsilon$} at some nominal values, we study the sensitivity of IceCube/DeepCore detector to dark matter spin-independent cross section {$\sigma$}pSI for m{$\chi$} ranging from few tens of GeV to 10 TeV. This sensitivity is compared with the existing IceCube 79-string constraint on the same cross section, which was obtained by searching for dark matter annihilations in the Sun. We compare this sensitivity to dark matter direct detection results as well, in particular the XENON100 (2012) limit and the parameter regions preferred by DAMA and CRESST-II experiments. We also present IceCube/DeepCore sensitivity to {$\sigma\upsilon$} as a function of m{$\chi$} by fixing {$\sigma$}pSI at XENON100 (2012) and XENON1T limits, respectively. This sensitivity is compared with the preferred dark matter parameter range derived from the combined fitting to PAMELA and AMS02 positron fraction data. We conclude that the search for dark matter annihilations in the Earth core provides competitive constraints on {$\sigma$}pSI and {$\sigma\upsilon$} in the case of low-mass dark matter. Particularly, the expected constraint on {$\sigma$}pSI for 5 years of data taking in IceCube/DeepCore is more stringent than the current IceCube 79-string limit mentioned above.},

  abstract     = {We introduce SPARC (Spitzer Photometry \& Accurate Rotation Curves): a sample of 175 nearby galaxies with new surface photometry at 3.6 um and high-quality rotation curves from previous HI/Halpha studies. SPARC spans a broad range of morphologies (S0 to Irr), luminosities (\textasciitilde 5 dex), and surface brightnesses (\textasciitilde 4 dex). We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass-HI mass relation and the stellar radius-HI radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the HI mass-radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic-to-observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) at [3.6]. Assuming M/L=0.5 Msun/Lsun (as suggested by stellar population models) we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity, (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of M/L=0.2 Msun/Lsun as suggested by the DiskMass survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is M/L=0.7 Msun/Lsun at [3.6]. The SPARC data are publicly available and represent an ideal test-bed for models of galaxy formation.},

In this work, we investigate spin-\$1/2\$ fermionic DM \$\textbackslash chi\$ charged under the \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson \$V\$ of \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ gauge group can be produced in NS via DM annihilation. The produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model (SM) particles before it exits the NS, despite its tiny couplings to SM particles. Thus, we perform a systematic study on \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2V\textbackslash to4\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ as a new heating mechanism for NS in addition to \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ and kinetic heating from DM-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to \$\textbackslash chi V\$ scattering is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass mixing terms between \$V\$ and SM gauge bosons are present. This allows both vector and axial-vector couplings between \$V\$ and SM fermions even for \$m\_V\textbackslash ll m\_Z\$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches to DM-induced NS heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses. Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the NS surface temperature by the future telescopes are discussed as well.},

This Letter reports results from LUX-ZEPLIN's first search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with an exposure of 60\textasciitilde live days using a fiducial mass of 5.5 t. A profile-likelihood ratio analysis shows the data to be consistent with a background-only hypothesis, setting new limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon, spin-dependent WIMP-neutron, and spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross sections for WIMP masses above 9 GeV/c\$\^2\$. The most stringent limit is set for spin-independent scattering at 36 GeV/c\$\^2\$, rejecting cross sections above 9.2\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-48\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ at the 90\% confidence level.},

  abstract      = {The axion emerges in extensions of the Standard Model that explain the absence of CP violation in the strong interactions. Simultaneously, it can provide naturally the cold dark matter in our universe. Several searches for axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) have constrained the corresponding parameter space over the last decades but no unambiguous hints of their existence have been found. The axion mass range below 1 meV remains highly attractive and a well motivated region for dark matter axions. In this White Paper we present a description of a new experiment based on the concept of a dielectric haloscope for the direct search of dark matter axions in the mass range of 40 to 400 \$\textbackslash mu\$eV. This MAgnetized Disk and Mirror Axion eXperiment (MADMAX) will consist of several parallel dielectric disks, which are placed in a strong magnetic field and with adjustable separations. This setting is expected to allow for an observable emission of axion induced electromagnetic waves at a frequency between 10 to 100 GHz corresponding to the axion mass.},

Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo. Finally we argue that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to other direct and indirect detection searches.},

  abstract     = {We consider current observational constraints on the electromagnetic charge of dark matter. The velocity dependence of the scattering cross-section through the photon gives rise to qualitatively different constraints than standard dark matter scattering through massive force carriers. In particular, recombination epoch observations of dark matter density perturbations require that \$\textbackslash epsilon\$, the ratio of the dark matter to electronic charge, is less than \$10\^\{-6\}\$ for \$m\_X = 1 GeV\$, rising to \$\textbackslash epsilon {$<$} 10\^\{-4\}\$ for \$m\_X = 10 TeV\$. Though naively one would expect that dark matter carrying a charge well below this constraint could still give rise to large scattering in current direct detection experiments, we show that charged dark matter particles that could be detected with upcoming experiments are expected to be evacuated from the Galactic disk by the Galactic magnetic fields and supernova shock waves, and hence will not give rise to a signal. Thus dark matter with a small charge is likely not a source of a signal in current or upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments.},

Since dark matter does not self-annihilate in the ADM scenario, dark matter accumulates in neutron stars, eventually reaching the Chandrasekhar limit and forming a black hole. We focus on the case of scalar ADM, where the constraints from Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent black hole formation are most severe due to the absence of Fermi degeneracy pressure. We also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space, non-trivial effects from Hawking radiation can modify our limits. We find that for scalar ADM with mass between 100 keV and 10\^5 GeV, the constraint from pulsars in globular clusters on the scattering cross-section with neutrons ranges from \textbackslash sigma\_n {$<$} 10\^\{-45\} cm\^2 to 10\^\{-52\} cm\vphantom\{\}\^2. In particular, for scalar ADM with mass between 1 GeV and 1 TeV (in the case where black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation is unimportant), the constraint on the scattering cross-section is below what is reachable with ton scale direct detection experiments.},

We focus on models of dark matter interacting by the exchange of light vector gauge bosons that couple to a conserved dark charge. In these models, dark matter accumulated in neutron stars can extend to large radii and enhance their tidal polarizability. Gravitational waves detected from the first binary neutron star merger GW170817 places useful constraints on such not-so compact objects.

It is commonly interpreted as the point at which dark matter signals become hidden underneath a remarkably similar-looking background from neutrinos. However, it has been known for some time that the neutrino floor is not a hard limit, but can be pushed past with sufficient statistics. As a consequence, some have recently advocated for calling it the "neutrino fog" instead. The downside of current methods of deriving the neutrino floor are that they rely on arbitrary choices of experimental exposure and energy threshold. Here we propose to define the neutrino floor as the boundary of the neutrino fog, and develop a calculation free from these assumptions. The technique is based on the derivative of a hypothetical experimental discovery limit as a function of exposure, and leads to a neutrino floor that is only influenced by the systematic uncertainties on the neutrino flux normalisations. Our floor is broadly similar to those found in the literature, but differs by almost an order of magnitude in the sub-GeV range, and above 20\textasciitilde GeV.},

Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the last few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

The chamber was operated at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 1.2 keV without loss of stability. A new blind 1404-kg-day exposure at 2.45 keV threshold was acquired with approximately the same expected total background rate as the previous 1167-kg-day exposure at 3.3 keV. This increased exposure is enabled in part by a new optical tracking analysis to better identify events near detector walls, permitting a larger fiducial volume.

We find good consistency with the standard spatially-flat 6-parameter \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology having a power-law spectrum of adiabatic scalar perturbations (denoted "base \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM" in this paper), from polarization, temperature, and lensing, separately and in combination. A combined analysis gives dark matter density \$\textbackslash Omega\_c h\^2 = 0.120\textbackslash pm 0.001\$, baryon density \$\textbackslash Omega\_b h\^2 = 0.0224\textbackslash pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965\textbackslash pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \$\textbackslash tau = 0.054\textbackslash pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03\textbackslash,\textbackslash\%\$ precision, with \$100\textbackslash theta\_*=1.0411\textbackslash pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4\textbackslash pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \$\textbackslash Omega\_m = 0.315\textbackslash pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \$\textbackslash sigma\_8 = 0.811\textbackslash pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model. Combining with BAO we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{\textbackslash rm eff\} = 2.99\textbackslash pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \$\textbackslash sum m\_\textbackslash nu{$<$} 0.12\$eV. The CMB spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM at over \$2\textbackslash,\textbackslash sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) BAO data.

  abstract      = {This paper describes the 2018 Planck CMB likelihoods, following a hybrid approach similar to the 2015 one, with different approximations at low and high multipoles, and implementing several methodological and analysis refinements. With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematics, we can now make full use of the High Frequency Instrument polarization data. The low-multipole 100x143 GHz EE cross-spectrum constrains the reionization optical-depth parameter \$\textbackslash tau\$ to better than 15\% (in combination with with the other low- and high-\$\textbackslash ell\$ likelihoods). We also update the 2015 baseline low-\$\textbackslash ell\$ joint TEB likelihood based on the Low Frequency Instrument data, which provides a weaker \$\textbackslash tau\$ constraint. At high multipoles, a better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (polarization efficiency or PE) allow us to fully use the polarization spectra, improving the constraints on the \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM parameters by 20 to 30\% compared to TT-only constraints. Tests on the modelling of the polarization demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties, the accuracy of the PE modelling being the main limitation. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-\$\textbackslash ell\$ implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5\$\textbackslash sigma\$ level. Minor curiosities already present before (differences between \$\textbackslash ell\${$<$}800 and \$\textbackslash ell\${$>$}800 parameters or the preference for more smoothing of the \$C\_\textbackslash ell\$ peaks) are shown to be driven by the TT power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of polarization. Overall, the legacy Planck CMB likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future CMB observations. (Abridged)},

The number of particles which would be captured by the sun up to its present age by the capture mechanism of scattering off individual nucleons in the sun and into bound orbits is computed. For scattering cross sections not too far from the value of 4 x 10 to the -36th sq cm, which is optimal for suppressing solar neutrinos, it is found that just the right number can be captured. The solutions to the neutrino problem in the sun and the missing mass problem in the Galaxy may thus be one and the same.},

  abstract     = {(Abridged) We compare recent results from X-ray, strong lensing, weak lensing, and optical observations with numerical simulations of the merging galaxy cluster 1E0657-56. X-ray observations reveal a bullet-like subcluster with a prominent bow shock, while lensing results show that the positions of the total mass peaks are consistent with the centroids of the collisionless galaxies (and inconsistent with the X-ray brightness peaks). Previous studies, based on older observational datasets, have placed upper limits on the self-interaction cross-section of dark matter per unit mass, sigma/m, using simplified analytic techniques. In this work, we take advantage of new, higher-quality observational datasets by running N-body simulations of 1E0657-56 that include the effects of self-interacting dark matter, and comparing the results with observations. Furthermore, the recent data allow for a new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation of an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid. This new method places an upper limit (68\% confidence) of sigma/m {$<$} 1.25 cm\^2/g. If we make the assumption that the subcluster and the main cluster had equal mass-to-light ratios prior to the merger, we derive our most stringent constraint of sigma/m {$<$} 0.7 cm\^2/g, which comes from the consistency of the subcluster's observed mass-to-light ratio with the main cluster's, and with the universal cluster value, ruling out the possibility of a large fraction of dark matter particles being scattered away due to collisions. Our limit is a slight improvement over the previous result from analytic estimates, and rules out most of the 0.5 - 5cm\^2/g range invoked to explain inconsistencies between the standard collisionless cold dark matter model and observations.},

  abstract     = {The recent formulation of the relativistic Thomas-Fermi model within the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller theory for compressed atoms is applied to the study of general relativistic white dwarf equilibrium configurations. The equation of state, which takes into account the \textbackslash beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear, and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the simple formula \$\textbackslash sqrt\{g\_\{00\}\}\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$= constant, which links the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$ with the general relativistic gravitational potential \$g\_\{00\}\$ at each point of the configuration. The configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as inverse \textbackslash beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of \$\^4\$He, \$\^\{12\}\$C, \$\^\{16\}\$O and \$\^\{56\}\$Fe white dwarfs are presented. All these effects should be taken into account in processes requiring a precision knowledge of the white dwarf parameters.},

Here we explore how the neutrino background will affect future ton-scale experiments considering both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions. We show that combining data from experiments using different targets can improve the dark matter discovery potential due to target complementarity. We find that in the context of spin-dependent interactions, combining results from several targets can greatly enhance the subtraction of the neutrino background for WIMP masses below 10 GeV/c\$\^2\$ and therefore probe dark matter models to lower cross-sections. In the context of target complementarity, we also explore how one can tune the relative exposures of different target materials to optimize the WIMP discovery potential.},

  abstract     = {The DAMA/NaI and DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation data, which may be interpreted as a signal for the existence of weakly interacting dark matter (WIMPs) in our galactic halo, are examined in light of null results from other experiments. We use the energy spectrum of the combined DAMA modulation data given in 36 bins, and include the effect of channeling. Several statistical tools are implemented in our study: likelihood ratio with a global fit and with raster scans in the WIMP mass and goodness-of-fit (g.o.f.). These approaches allow us to differentiate between the preferred (global best fit) and allowed (g.o.f.) parameter regions. It is hard to find WIMP masses and couplings consistent with all existing data sets. For spin-independent (SI) interactions, the best fit DAMA regions are ruled out to the 3\$\textbackslash sigma\$ C.L., even with channeling taken into account. However, for WIMP masses of \textasciitilde 8 GeV some parameters outside these regions still yield a moderately reasonable fit to the DAMA data and are compatible with all 90\% C.L. upper limits from negative searches, when channeling is included. For spin-dependent (SD) interactions with proton-only couplings, a range of masses below 10 GeV is compatible with DAMA and other experiments, with and without channeling, when SuperK indirect detection constraints are included; without the SuperK constraints, masses as high as \textasciitilde 20 GeV are compatible. For SD neutron-only couplings we find no parameters compatible with all the experiments. Mixed SD couplings are examined: e.g. \textasciitilde 8 GeV mass WIMPs with a\_n = +/- a\_p are found to be consistent with all experiments. In short, there are surviving regions at low mass for both SI and SD interactions; if indirect detection limits are relaxed, some SD proton-only couplings at high masses also survive.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter charged under a new gauge sector, as motivated by recent data, suggests a rich GeV-scale "dark sector" weakly coupled to the Standard Model by gauge kinetic mixing. The new gauge bosons can decay to Standard Model leptons, but this mode is suppressed if decays into lighter dark sector particles are kinematically allowed. These particles in turn typically have macroscopic decay lifetimes that are constrained by two classes of experiments, which we discuss. Lifetimes of 10 cm {$<$} c tau {$<$} 10\^8 cm are constrained by existing terrestrial beam-dump experiments. If, in addition, dark matter captured in the Sun (or Earth) annihilates into these particles, lifetimes up to 10\^15 cm are constrained by solar observations. These bounds span fourteen orders of magnitude in lifetime, but they are not exhaustive. Accordingly, we identify promising new directions for experiments including searches for displaced di-muons in B-factories, studies at high-energy and -intensity proton beam dumps, precision gamma-ray and electronic measurements of the Sun, and milli-charge searches re-analyzed in this new context.},

Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

  abstract     = {If dark matter (DM) is a weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) that is a thermal relic of the early Universe, then its total self-annihilation cross section is revealed by its present-day mass density. The canonical thermally averaged cross section for a generic WIMP is usually stated as 3*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1, with unspecified uncertainty, and taken to be independent of WIMP mass. Recent searches for annihilation products of DM annihilation have just reached the sensitivity to exclude this canonical cross section for 100\% branching ratio to certain final states and small WIMP masses. The ultimate goal is to probe all kinematically allowed final states as a function of mass and, if all states are adequately excluded, set a lower limit to the WIMP mass. Probing the low-mass region is further motivated due to recent hints for a light WIMP in direct and indirect searches. We revisit the thermal relic abundance calculation for a generic WIMP and show that the required cross section can be calculated precisely. It varies significantly with mass at masses below 10 GeV, reaching a maximum of 5.2*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1 at masses around 0.3 GeV, and is 2.2*10\^-26 cm\^3s\^-1 with feeble mass-dependence for masses above 10 GeV. These results, which differ significantly from the canonical value and have not been taken into account in searches for annihilation products from generic WIMPs, have a noticeable impact on the interpretation of present limits from Fermi-LAT and WMAP+ACT.},

  abstract      = {Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ \$\textbackslash sim\$ 200-GeV/\$c\^2\$) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton cross section for WIMP masses below 200 GeV/\$c\^2\$ (at 10 GeV/\$c\^2\$, 1.49\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-39\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow b \textbackslash bar\{b\}\$ and 1.31\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-40\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash tau\^+\textbackslash tau\^-\$ annihilation channels), also ruling out some fraction of WIMP candidates with spin-independent (SI) coupling in the few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ mass range.},

In such cases astrophysical studies can help to expand the range of values significantly. Among astronomical sources, used in interests of fundamental physics, compact objects -- neutron stars and white dwarfs, -- play a leading role. We review several aspects of astroparticle physics studies related to observations and properties of these celestial bodies. Dark matter particles can be collected inside compact objects resulting in additional heating or collapse. We summarize regimes and rates of particle capturing as well as possible astrophysical consequences. Then we focus on a particular type of hypothetical particles -- axions. Their existence can be uncovered due to observations of emission originated due to Primakoff process in magnetospheres of neutron stars or white dwarfs. Alternatively, they can contribute to cooling of these compact objects. We present results in these areas, including upper limits based on recent observations.},

Based on a detailed population synthesis model, we apply a method that relies on Gaia astrometry and photometry to accurately derive the individual white dwarf parameters (mass, radius, effective temperature, bolometric luminosity and age). This method is tested with 25 white dwarfs of our sample for which we took optical spectra and performed spectroscopic analysis. We build and analyse the halo white dwarf luminosity function, for which we find for the first time possible evidences of the cut-off at its faintest end, leading to an age estimate of {$\simeq$} 12 {$\pm$} 0.5 Gyr. The mass distribution of the sample peaks at 0.589 {$\odot$}, with 71\% of the white dwarf masses below 0.6 {$\odot$} and just two massive white dwarfs of more than 0.8 {$\odot$}. From the age distribution we find three white dwarfs with total ages above 12 Gyr, of which J1312-4728 is the oldest white dwarf known with an age of 12.41 {$\pm$} 0.22 Gyr. We prove that the star formation history is mainly characterised by a burst of star formation that occurred from 10 to 12 Gyr in the past, but extended up to 8 Gyr. We also find that the peak of the star formation history is centered at around 11 Gyr, which is compatible with the current age of the Gaia-Enceladus encounter. Finally, 13\% of our halo sample is contaminated by high-speed young objects (total age{$<$}7 Gyr). The origin of these white dwarfs is unclear but their age distribution may be compatible with the encounter with the Sagittarius galaxy.},

No significant discrepancies with respect to the Standard Model predictions have been found in data, so that limits on the dark matter couplings to ordinary matter, or limits on the dark matter particles and mediators masses have been set. The results are also re-interpreted as limits on the dark matter interaction cross-section with baryonic matter, so that a comparison with direct detection experiments is allowed.},

  abstract     = {We review theories of dark matter (DM) beyond the collisionless paradigm, known as self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), and their observable implications for astrophysical structure in the Universe. Self-interactions are motivated, in part, due to the potential to explain long-standing (and more recent) small scale structure observations that are in tension with collisionless cold DM (CDM) predictions. Simple particle physics models for SIDM can provide a universal explanation for these observations across a wide range of mass scales spanning dwarf galaxies, low and high surface brightness spiral galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. At the same time, SIDM leaves intact the success of \$\textbackslash Lambda\$CDM cosmology on large scales. This report covers the following topics: (1) small scale structure issues, including the core-cusp problem, the diversity problem for rotation curves, the missing satellites problem, and the too-big-to-fail problem, as well as recent progress in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation; (2) N-body simulations for SIDM, including implications for density profiles, halo shapes, substructure, and the interplay between baryons and self-interactions; (3) semi-analytic Jeans-based methods that provide a complementary approach for connecting particle models with observations; (4) merging systems, such as cluster mergers (e.g., the Bullet Cluster) and minor infalls, along with recent simulation results for mergers; (5) particle physics models, including light mediator models and composite DM models; and (6) complementary probes for SIDM, including indirect and direct detection experiments, particle collider searches, and cosmological observations. We provide a summary and critical look for all current constraints on DM self-interactions and an outline for future directions.},

  abstract     = {We use the formalism of Gould and Raffelt to compute the dimensionless thermal conduction coefficients for scattering of dark matter particles with standard model nucleons via cross-sections that depend on the relative velocity or momentum exchanged between particles. Motivated by models invoked to reconcile various recent results in direct detection, we explicitly compute the conduction coefficients \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash kappa\$ for cross-sections that go as \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^2\$, \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^4\$, \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^\{-2\}\$, \$q\^2\$, \$q\^4\$ and \$q\^\{-2\}\$, where \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\$ is the relative DM-nucleus velocity and \$q\$ is the momentum transferred in the collision. We find that a \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^\{-2\}\$ dependence can significantly enhance energy transport from the inner solar core to the outer core. The same can true for any \$q\$-dependent coupling, if the dark matter mass lies within some specific range for each coupling. This effect can complement direct searches for dark matter; combining these results with state-of-the-art Solar simulations should greatly increase sensitivity to certain DM models. It also seems possible that the so-called Solar Abundance Problem could be resolved by enhanced energy transport in the solar core due to such velocity- or momentum-dependent scatterings.},

  abstract     = {The dense matter equation of state (EOS) determines neutron star (NS) structure but can be calculated reliably only up to one to two times the nuclear saturation density, using accurate many-body methods that employ nuclear interactions from chiral effective field theory constrained by scattering data. In this work, we use physically motivated ansatzes for the speed of sound \$c\_S\$ at high density to extend microscopic calculations of neutron-rich matter to the highest densities encountered in stable NS cores. We show how existing and expected astrophysical constraints on NS masses and radii from X-ray observations can constrain the speed of sound in the NS core. We confirm earlier expectations that \$c\_S\$ is likely to violate the conformal limit of \$c\_S\^{}2\textbackslash leq c\^{}2/3 \$, possibly reaching values closer to the speed of light \$c\$ at a few times the nuclear saturation density, independent of the nuclear Hamiltonian. If QCD obeys the conformal limit, we conclude that the rapid increase of \$c\_S\$ required to accommodate a \$2 \$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$ NS suggests a form of strongly interacting matter where a description in terms of nucleons will be unwieldy, even between one and two times the nuclear saturation density. For typical NSs with masses in the range \$1.2-1.4\textasciitilde\$ M\$\_\textbackslash odot\$, we find radii between \$10\$ and \$14\$ km, and the smallest possible radius of a \$1.4\$ M\$\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\$ NS consistent with constraints from nuclear physics and observations is \$8.4\$ km. We also discuss how future observations could constrain the EOS and guide theoretical developments in nuclear physics.},

  abstract      = {On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function \$p(\textbackslash rho)\$ of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star radii as \$R\_1=10.8\^{}\{+2.0\}\_\{-1.7\}\$ km for the heavier star and \$R\_2= 10.7\^{}\{+2.1\}\_\{-1.5\}\$ km for the lighter star at the 90\% credible level. If we additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than \$1.97 \textbackslash,M\_\textbackslash odot\$ as required from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further constrain \$R\_1= 11.9\^{}\{+1.4\}\_\{-1.4\}\$ km and \$R\_2= 11.9\^{}\{+1.4\}\_\{-1.4\}\$ km at the 90\% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on \$p(\textbackslash rho)\$ at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at \$3.5\^{}\{+2.7\}\_\{-1.7\}\textbackslash times 10\^{}\{34\} \textbackslash,\textbackslash mathrm\{dyn\}/\textbackslash mathrm\{cm\}\^{}\{2\}\$ at the 90\% level.},

We construct and calibrate to published results a semi-analytic model of the neutron star atmosphere which approximates these effects for the predicted masses and radii. Starting from mass and radius probability distributions established from hydrogen-atmosphere spectral fits of quiescent sources, we apply this model to compute alternate sets of probability distributions. We perform Bayesian analyses to estimate neutron star mass-radius curves and equation of state (EOS) parameters that best-fit each set of distributions, assuming the existence of a known low-density neutron star crustal EOS, a simple model for the high-density EOS, causality, and the observation that the neutron star maximum mass exceeds \$2\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$. We compute the posterior probabilities for each set of distance measurements and assumptions about absorption and composition. We find that, within the context of our assumptions and our parameterized EOS models, some absorption models are disfavored. We find that neutron stars composed of hadrons are favored relative to those with exotic matter with strong phase transitions. In addition, models in which all five stars have hydrogen atmospheres are found to be weakly disfavored. Our most likely models predict neutron star radii that are consistent with current experimental results concerning the nature of the nucleon-nucleon interaction near the nuclear saturation density.},

We incorporate, for the first time, a large number of systematic uncertainties in the measurement of the apparent angular sizes, Eddington fluxes, and distances, in the composition of the interstellar medium, and in the flux calibration of X-ray detectors. We also take into account the results of recent theoretical calculations of rotational effects on neutron star radii, of atmospheric effects on surface spectra, and of relativistic corrections to the Eddington critical flux. We employ Bayesian statistical frameworks to obtain neutron star radii from the spectroscopic measurements as well as to infer the equation of state from the radius measurements. Combining these with the results of experiments in the vicinity of nuclear saturation density and the observations of \textasciitilde 2 Msun neutron stars, we place strong and quantitative constraints on the properties of the equation of state between approximately 2-8 times the nuclear saturation density. We find that around M=1.5 Msun, the preferred equation of state predicts radii between 10.1 - 11.1 km. When interpreting the pressure constraints in the context of high density equations of state based on interacting nucleons, our results suggest a relatively weak contribution of the three-body interaction potential.},

These discoveries show that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

We critically assess the mass and radius determinations from the X-ray burst sources and show explicitly how systematic uncertainties, such as the photospheric radius at touchdown, affect the most probable masses and radii. We introduce a parameterized equation of state and use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to determine nuclear parameters such as the incompressibility and the density dependence of the bulk symmetry energy. Using this framework we show, for the first time, that these parameters, predicted solely on the basis of astrophysical observations, all lie in ranges expected from nuclear systematics and laboratory experiments. We find significant constraints on the mass-radius relation for neutron stars, and hence on the pressure-density relation of dense matter. The predicted symmetry energy and the equation of state near the saturation density are soft, resulting in relatively small neutron star radii around 11-12 km for M=1.4 Msun. The predicted equation of state stiffens at higher densities, however, and our preferred model for X-ray bursts suggests that the neutron star maximum mass is relatively large, 1.9-2.2 Msun. Our results imply that several commonly used equations of state are inconsistent with observations.},

In this work, we determine the neutron star mass-radius relation and, based on recent observations of both transiently accreting and bursting sources, we show that the radius of a 1.4 solar mass neutron star lies between 10.4 and 12.9 km, independent of assumptions about the composition of the core. We show, for the first time, that these constraints remain valid upon removal from our sample of the most extreme transient sources or of the entire set of bursting sources; our constraints also apply even if deconfined quark matter exists in the neutron star core. Our results significantly constrain the dense matter EOS and are, furthermore, consistent with constraints from both heavy-ion collisions and theoretical studies of neutron matter. We predict a relatively weak dependence of the symmetry energy on the density and a value for the neutron skin thickness of lead which is less than 0.20 fm, results that are testable in forthcoming experiments.},

We condition on informative pulsar mass, distance, and orbital inclination priors derived from the joint North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves and Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment/Pulsar wideband radio timing measurements of Fonseca et al. We use XMM-Newton European Photon Imaging Camera spectroscopic event data to inform our X-ray likelihood function. The prior support of the pulsar radius is truncated at 16 km to ensure coverage of current dense matter models. We assume conservative priors on instrument calibration uncertainty. We constrain the equatorial radius and mass of PSR J0740+6620 to be km and M {$\odot$} respectively, each reported as the posterior credible interval bounded by the 16\% and 84\% quantiles, conditional on surface hot regions that are non-overlapping spherical caps of fully ionized hydrogen atmosphere with uniform effective temperature; a posteriori, the temperature is for each hot region. All software for the X-ray modeling framework is open-source and all data, model, and sample information is publicly available, including analysis notebooks and model modules in the Python language. Our marginal likelihood function of mass and equatorial radius is proportional to the marginal joint posterior density of those parameters (within the prior support) and can thus be computed from the posterior samples.},

  abstract     = {PSR J0740+6620 has a gravitational mass of 2.08 \textpm{} 0.07 M , which is the highest reliably determined mass of any neutron star. As a result, a measurement of its radius will provide unique insight into the properties of neutron star core matter at high densities. Here we report a radius measurement based on fits of rotating hot spot patterns to Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) X-ray observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is 13.7+-12..65 km (68\%). We apply our measurement, combined with the previous NICER mass and radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451, the masses of two other {$\sim$} 2 M pulsars, and the tidal deformability constraints from two gravitational wave events, to three different frameworks for equation of state modeling, and find consistent results at {$\sim$} 1.5 - 3 times nuclear saturation density. For a given framework, when all measurements are included the radius of a 1.4 M neutron star is known to \textpm 4\% (68\% credibility) and the radius of a 2.08 M neutron star is known to \textpm 5\%. The full radius range that spans the \textpm 1{$\sigma$} credible intervals of all the radius estimates in the three frameworks is 12.45 \textpm{} 0.65 km for a 1.4 M neutron star and 12.35 \textpm{} 0.75 km for a 2.08 M neutron star.},

  abstract     = {We report results from continued timing observations of PSR J0740+6620, a high-mass, 2.8-ms radio pulsar in orbit with a likely ultra-cool white dwarf companion. Our data set consists of combined pulse arrival-time measurements made with the 100-m Green Bank Telescope and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment telescope. We explore the significance of timing-based phenomena arising from general-relativistic dynamics and variations in pulse dispersion. When using various statistical methods, we find that combining {$\sim$} 1.5 years of additional, high-cadence timing data with previous measurements confirms and improves upon previous estimates of relativistic effects within the PSR J0740+6620 system, with the pulsar mass mp = 2.08+-00..0077 M (68.3\% credibility) determined by the relativistic Shapiro time delay. For the first time, we measure secular variation in the orbital period and argue that this effect arises from apparent acceleration due to significant transverse motion. After incorporating contributions from Galactic differential rotation and off-plane acceleration in the Galactic potential, we obtain a model-dependent distance of d = 1.14+-00..1175 kpc (68.3\% credibility). This improved distance confirms the ultra-cool nature of the white dwarf companion determined from recent optical observations. We discuss the prospects for future observations with next-generation facilities, which will likely improve the precision on mp for J0740+6620 by an order of magnitude within the next few years.},

  abstract      = {Despite its importance to our understanding of physics at supranuclear densities, the equation of state (EoS) of matter deep within neutron stars remains poorly understood. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are among the most useful astrophysical objects in the Universe for testing fundamental physics, and place some of the most stringent constraints on this high-density EoS. Pulsar timing---the process of accounting for every rotation of a pulsar over long time periods---can precisely measure a wide variety of physical phenomena, including those that allow the measurement of the masses of the components of a pulsar binary system1. One of these, called relativistic Shapiro delay2, can yield precise masses for both an MSP and its companion; however, it is only easily observed in a small subset of high-precision, highly inclined (nearly edge-on) binary pulsar systems. By combining data from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) 12.5-yr data set with recent orbital-phase-specific observations using the Green Bank Telescope, we have measured the mass of the MSP J0740+6620 to be 2 .14-0.09 +0 .10 ? M{$\odot$} (68.3\% credibility interval; the 95.4\% credibility interval is 2 .14-0.18 +0 .20 ? M{$\odot$}). It is highly likely to be the most massive neutron star yet observed, and serves as a strong constraint on the neutron star interior EoS.},

We perform Bayesian parameter estimation with the source location and distance informed by electromagnetic observations. We also assume that the two stars have the same equation of state; we demonstrate that for stars with masses comparable to the component masses of GW170817, this is effectively implemented by assuming that the stars' dimensionless tidal deformabilities are determined by the binary's mass ratio \$q\$ by \$\textbackslash Lambda\_1/\textbackslash Lambda\_2 = q\^{}6\$. We investigate different choices of prior on the component masses of the neutron stars. We find that the tidal deformability and 90\$\textbackslash\%\$ credible interval is \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash Lambda\}=222\^{}\{+420\}\_\{-138\}\$ for a uniform component mass prior, \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash Lambda\}=245\^{}\{+453\}\_\{-151\}\$ for a component mass prior informed by radio observations of Galactic double neutron stars, and \$\textbackslash tilde\{\textbackslash Lambda\}=233\^{}\{+448\}\_\{-144\}\$ for a component mass prior informed by radio pulsars. We find a robust measurement of the common areal radius of the neutron stars across all mass priors of \$8.9 \textbackslash le \textbackslash hat\{R\} \textbackslash le 13.2\$ km, with a mean value of \$\textbackslash langle \textbackslash hat\{R\} \textbackslash rangle = 10.8\$ km.

  abstract      = {On 17 August 2017, the LIGO and Virgo observatories made the first direct detection of gravitational waves from the coalescence of a neutron star binary system. The detection of this gravitational-wave signal, GW170817, offers a novel opportunity to directly probe the properties of matter at the extreme conditions found in the interior of these stars. The initial, minimal-assumption analysis of the LIGO and Virgo data placed constraints on the tidal effects of the coalescing bodies, which were then translated to constraints on neutron star radii. Here, we expand upon previous analyses by working under the hypothesis that both bodies were neutron stars that are described by the same equation of state and have spins within the range observed in Galactic binary neutron stars. Our analysis employs two methods: the use of equation-of-state-insensitive relations between various macroscopic properties of the neutron stars and the use of an efficient parametrization of the defining function p ({$\rho$} ) of the equation of state itself. From the LIGO and Virgo data alone and the first method, we measure the two neutron star radii as R1=10.8-1.7+2.0 km for the heavier star and R2=10.7-1.5+2.1 km for the lighter star at the 90\% credible level. If we additionally require that the equation of state supports neutron stars with masses larger than 1.97 M{$\odot$} as required from electromagnetic observations and employ the equation-of-state parametrization, we further constrain R1=11.9-1.4+1.4 km and R2=11.9-1.4+1.4 km at the 90\% credible level. Finally, we obtain constraints on p ({$\rho$} ) at supranuclear densities, with pressure at twice nuclear saturation density measured at 3.5-1.7+2.7\texttimes 1034 dyn cm-2 at the 90\% level.},

  abstract     = {Context. An equation of state (EoS) of dense nuclear matter is a prerequisite for studies of the structure and evolution of compact stars. A unified EoS should describe the crust and the core of a neutron star using the same physical model. The Brussels-Montreal group has recently derived a family of such EoSs based on the nuclear energy-density functional theory with generalized Skyrme effective forces that have been fitted with great precision to essentially all the available mass data. At the same time, these forces were constrained to reproduce microscopic calculations of homogeneous neutron matter based on realistic two- and three-nucleon forces.},

  abstract     = {Self-consistent mean field models are a powerful tool in the investigation of nuclear structure and low-energy dynamics. They are based on effective energy-density functionals, often formulated in terms of effective density-dependent nucleon--nucleon interactions. The free parameters of the functional are adjusted to empirical data. A proper choice of these parameters requires a comprehensive set of constraints covering experimental data on finite nuclei, concerning static as well as dynamical properties, empirical characteristics of nuclear matter, and observational information on nucleosynthesis, neutron stars and supernovae. This work aims at a comprehensive survey of the performance of one of the most successful non-relativistic self-consistent method, the Skyrme--Hartree--Fock model (SHF), with respect to these constraints. A full description of the Skyrme functional is given and its relation to other effective interactions is discussed. The validity of the application of SHF far from stability and in dense environments beyond the nuclear saturation density is critically assessed. The use of SHF in models extended beyond the mean field approximation by including some correlations, is discussed. Finally, future prospects for further development of SHF towards a more consistent application of the existing and promising newly developing constraints are outlined.},

  abstract     = {A new classification of neutron star cooling scenarios, involving either ``minimal'' cooling or ``enhanced'' cooling is proposed. The minimal cooling scenario replaces and extends the so-called standard cooling scenario to include neutrino emission from the Cooper pair breaking and formation process. This emission dominates that due to the modified Urca process for temperatures close to the critical temperature for superfluid pairing. Minimal cooling is distinguished from enhanced cooling by the absence of neutrino emission from any direct Urca process, due either to nucleons or to exotica. Within the minimal cooling scenario, theoretical cooling models can be considered to be a four parameter family involving the equation of state of dense matter, superfluid properties of dense matter, the composition of the neutron star envelope, and the mass of the neutron star. Consequences of minimal cooling are explored through extensive variations of these parameters. Results are compared with the inferred properties of thermally-emitting neutron stars in order to ascertain if enhanced cooling occurs in any of them. All stars for which thermal emissions have been clearly detected are at least marginally consistent with the lack of enhanced cooling. The two pulsars PSR 0833-45 (Vela) and PSR 1706-44 would require enhanced cooling in case their ages and/or temperatures are on the lower side of their estimated values whereas the four stars PSR 0656+14, PSR 1055-52, Geminga, and RX J0720.4-3125 may require some source of internal heating in case their age and/or luminosity are on the upper side of their estimated values. The new upper limits on the thermal luminosity of PSR J0205+6449 and RX J0007.0+7302 are indicative of the occurrence of some enhanced neutrino emission beyond the minimal scenario.},

This approach leads to simple scaling relations for the changes of hadron masses in a nuclear medium. It can also be extended to describe finite nuclei, as well as the properties of hypernuclei and meson-nucleus deeply bound states. It is of great interest that the model predicts a variation of the nucleon form factors in nuclear matter. We also study the empirically observed, Bloom-Gilman (quark-hadron) duality. Other applications of the model include subthreshold kaon production in heavy ion collisions, D and D-bar meson production in antiproton-nucleus collisions, and J/Psi suppression. In particular, the modification of the D and D-bar meson properties in nuclear medium can lead to a large J/Psi absorption cross section, which explains the observed J/Psi suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions.},

The pulsars were observed with the Arecibo Observatory and/or the Green Bank Telescope at frequencies ranging from 327 MHz to 2.3 GHz. Most pulsars were observed with approximately monthly cadence, with six high--timing-precision pulsars observed weekly, and all were observed at widely separated frequencies at each observing epoch in order to fit for time-variable dispersion delays. We describe our methods for data processing, time-of-arrival (TOA) calculation, and the implementation of a new, automated method for removing outlier TOAs. We fit a timing model for each pulsar that includes spin, astrometric, and, if necessary, binary parameters, in addition to time-variable dispersion delays and parameters that quantify pulse-profile evolution with frequency. The new timing solutions provide three new parallax measurements, two new Shapiro delay measurements, and two new measurements of large orbital-period variations. We fit models that characterize sources of noise for each pulsar. We find that 11 pulsars show significant red noise, with generally smaller spectral indices than typically measured for non-recycled pulsars, possibly suggesting a different origin. Future papers will use these data to constrain or detect the signatures of gravitational-wave signals.},

Net strangeness is carried by hyperons, K-mesons, H-dibaryons, and strange quark matter, and may leave its mark in the masses, radii, moment of inertia, dragging of local inertial frames, cooling behavior, surface composition, and the spin evolution of neutron stars. These observables play a key role for the exploration of the phase diagram of dense nuclear matter at high baryon number density but low temperature, which is not accessible to relativistic heavy ion collision experiments.},
