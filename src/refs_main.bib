  abstract     = {White dwarfs (WDs) are the most promising captors of dark matter (DM) particles in the crests that are expected to build up in the cores of dense stellar clusters. The DM particles could reach sufficient densities in WD cores to liberate energy through self-annihilation. The extinction associated with our Galactic Centre, the most promising region where to look for such effects, makes it impossible to detect the potential associated luminosity of the DM-burning WDs. However, in smaller stellar systems which are close enough to us and not heavily extincted, such as \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen, we may be able to detect DM-burning WDs. We investigate the prospects of detection of DM-burning WDs in a stellar cluster harbouring an IMBH, which leads to higher densities of DM at the centre as compared with clusters without one. We calculate the capture rate of WIMPs by a WD around an IMBH and estimate the luminosity that a WD would emit depending on its distance to the center of the cluster. Direct-summation \$N-\$body simulations of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen yield a non-negligible number of WDs in the range of radii of interest. We apply our assumption to published HST/ACS observations of stars in the center of \$\textbackslash omega-\$Cen to search for DM burning WDs and, although we are not able to identify any evident candidate because of crowding and incompleteness, we proof that their bunching up at high luminosities would be unique. We predict that DM burning will lead to a truncation of the cooling sequence at the faint end. The detection of DM burning in future observations of dense stellar clusters, such as globular clusters or ultra-compact dwarf galaxies could allow us to probe different models of DM distributions and characteristics such as the DM particle scattering cross section on nucleons. On the other hand, if DM-burning WDs really exist, their number and properties could give hints to the existence of IMBHs.},

  abstract     = {We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.},

  abstract     = {We identify a largely model-independent signature of dark matter interactions with nucleons and electrons. Dark matter in the local galactic halo, gravitationally accelerated to over half the speed of light, scatters against and deposits kinetic energy into neutron stars, heating them to infrared blackbody temperatures. The resulting radiation could potentially be detected by the James Webb Space Telescope, the Thirty Meter Telescope, or the European Extremely Large Telescope. This mechanism also produces optical emission from neutron stars in the galactic bulge, and X-ray emission near the galactic center, because dark matter is denser in these regions. For GeV - PeV mass dark matter, dark kinetic heating would initially unmask any spin-independent or spin-dependent dark matter-nucleon cross-sections exceeding \$2 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-45\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, with improved sensitivity after more telescope exposure. For lighter-than-GeV dark matter, cross-section sensitivity scales inversely with dark matter mass because of Pauli blocking; for heavier-than-PeV dark matter, it scales linearly with mass as a result of needing multiple scatters for capture. Future observations of dark sector-warmed neutron stars could determine whether dark matter annihilates in or only kinetically heats neutron stars. Because inelastic inter-state transitions of up to a few GeV would occur in relativistic scattering against nucleons, elusive inelastic dark matter like pure Higgsinos can also be discovered.},

This naturally occurs if the mean free path of the mediator is in excess of the solar (or planetary) radius. We show that existing constraints from water Cerenkov detectors already provide a novel probe of the parameter space of these models, complementary to other sources, with significant scope for future improvement from high angular resolution gamma-ray telescopes such as Fermi-LAT. Fluxes of charged particles produced in mediator decays are also capable of contributing a significant solar system component to the spectrum of energetic electrons and positrons, a possibility which can be tested with the directional and timing information of PAMELA and Fermi.},

In this class of models, dark matter annihilates first into metastable mediators, which subsequently decay into Standard Model particles. If the mediators are long lived, they will propagate out from the dense solar core before decaying. High energy neutrinos undergo absorption in the Sun. In the standard scenario in which neutrinos are produced directly in the centre of the Sun, absorption is relevant for E {$>$} 100 GeV, resulting in a significant suppression of the neutrino spectrum beyond E \textasciitilde{} 1 TeV. In the secluded dark matter scenario, the neutrino signal is greatly enhanced because neutrinos are injected away from the core, at lower density. Since the solar density falls exponentially with radius, metastable mediators have a significant effect on the neutrino flux, even for decay lengths which are small compared to the solar radius. Moreover, since neutrino detection cross sections grow with energy, this enhancement of the high energy region of the neutrino spectrum would have a large effect on overall event rates.},

If non-annihilating dark matter is captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

  abstract     = {Neutron stars provide a cosmic laboratory to study the nature of dark matter particles and their interactions. Dark matter can be captured by neutron stars via scattering, where kinetic energy is transferred to the star. This can have a number of observational consequences, such as the heating of old neutron stars to infra-red temperatures. Previous treatments of the capture process have employed various approximation or simplifications. We present here an improved treatment of dark matter capture, valid for a wide dark matter mass range, that correctly incorporates all relevant physical effects. These include gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli blocking, neutron star opacity and multi-scattering effects. We provide general expressions that enable the exact capture rate to be calculated numerically, and derive simplified expressions that are valid for particular interaction types or mass regimes and that greatly increase the computational efficiency. Our formalism is applicable to the scattering of dark matter from any neutron star constituents, or to the capture of dark matter in other compact objects.},

We recently developed an improved treatment of dark matter (DM) capture in neutron stars that properly incorporates many of the important physical effects, and outlined useful analytic approximations that are valid when the scattering amplitude is independent of the centre of mass energy. We now extend that analysis to all interaction types. We also discuss the effect of going beyond the zero-temperature approximation, which provides a boost to the capture rate of low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter from leptonic targets, for which a correct relativistic description is essential. We find that the potential neutron star sensitivity to DM-lepton scattering cross sections greatly exceeds electron-recoil experiments, particularly in the sub-GeV regime, with a sensitivity to sub-MeV DM well beyond the reach of future terrestrial experiments.},

Properly incorporating these effects is found to suppress the dark matter capture rate by up to four orders of magnitude for the heaviest stars.},

  abstract     = {White dwarfs, the most abundant stellar remnants, provide a promising means of probing dark matter (DM) interactions, complimentary to terrestrial searches. The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to gravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In particular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark matter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of captured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on either the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions, we account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form factors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects pertinent to sub-GeV dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic, degenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple scattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter evaporation rate. The DM-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be constrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with observations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply this technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster Messier 4, which we assume to be located in a DM subhalo. For DM-nucleon scattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-GeV mass range inaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only by either evaporation or dominant DM annihilation to neutrinos, and can be competitive with direct detection in the \$1-10\^4\$ GeV range. White dwarf limits on dark matter-electron scattering are found to outperform current electron recoil experiments over the full mass range considered, and extend well beyond the \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV mass regime where the sensitivity of electron recoil experiments is reduced.},

First, NS-imploding dark matter forms \$\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-10\}\$ solar mass or smaller black holes inside neutron stars, which proceed to convert neutron stars into \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass BHs. This decreases the number of neutron star mergers seen by LIGO/Virgo (LV) and associated merger kilonovae seen by telescopes like DES, BlackGEM, and ZTF, and instead, producing a population of "black mergers" containing \$\textbackslash sim\$1.5 solar mass black holes. Second, dark matter-induced neutron star implosions may create a new kind of kilonovae that lacks a detectable, accompanying gravitational signal, which we call "quiet kilonovae." Using DES data and the Milky Way's r-process abundance, we constrain quiet kilonovae. Third, the spatial distribution of neutron star merger kilonovae and quiet kilonovae in galaxies can be used to detect dark matter. NS-imploding dark matter destroys most neutron stars at the centers of disc galaxies, so that neutron star merger kilonovae would appear mostly in a donut at large radii. We find that as few as ten neutron star merger kilonova events, located to \$\textbackslash sim\$1 kpc precision could validate or exclude dark matter-induced neutron star implosions at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence, exploring dark matter-nucleon cross-sections 4-10 orders of magnitude below current direct detection experimental limits. Similarly, NS-imploding dark matter as the source of fast radio bursts can be tested at \$2 \textbackslash sigma\$ confidence once 20 bursts are located in host galaxies by radio arrays like CHIME and HIRAX.},

However, for all values of m\_DM in these theories, the mediator width is larger than the mass, so that a particle-like interpretation of the mediator is doubtful.

  abstract      = {A search for dark matter particles is performed using events with large missing transverse momentum, at least one energetic jet, and no leptons, in proton-proton collisions at sqrt(s) = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector at the LHC. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 inverse femtobarns. The search includes events with jets from the hadronic decays of a W or Z boson. The data are found to be in agreement with the predicted background contributions from standard model processes. The results are presented in terms of simplified models in which dark matter particles are produced through interactions involving a vector, axial-vector, scalar, or pseudoscalar mediator. Vector and axial-vector mediator particles with masses up to 1.95 TeV, and scalar and pseudoscalar mediator particles with masses up to 100 and 430 GeV respectively, are excluded at 95\% confidence level. The results are also interpreted in terms of the invisible decays of the Higgs boson, yielding an observed (expected) 95\% confidence level upper limit of 0.44 (0.56) on the corresponding branching fraction. The results of this search provide the strongest constraints on the dark matter pair production cross section through vector and axial-vector mediators at a particle collider. When compared to the direct detection experiments, the limits obtained from this search provide stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 5, 9, and 550 GeV, assuming vector, scalar, and axial-vector mediators, respectively. The search yields stronger constraints for dark matter masses less than 200 GeV, assuming a pseudoscalar mediator, when compared to the indirect detection results from Fermi-LAT.},

Our criteria indicate up to what cutoff energy scale, and with what precision, the effective description is valid, depending on the dark matter mass and couplings.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter with momentum- or velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei has shown significant promise for explaining the so-called Solar Abundance Problem, a longstanding discrepancy between solar spectroscopy and helioseismology. The best-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5 GeV. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun can be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of such models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the first time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions, thermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically thin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that depending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass below which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 GeV. This has the effect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance Problem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also provide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account thermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly matched to the well-known saturation limit.},

  abstract      = {Dark matter elastic scattering off nuclei can result in the excitation and ionization of the recoiling atom through the so-called Migdal effect. The energy deposition from the ionization electron adds to the energy deposited by the recoiling nuclear system and allows for the detection of interactions of sub-GeV/c\$\^2\$ mass dark matter. We present new constraints for sub-GeV/c\$\^2\$ dark matter using the dual-phase liquid argon time projection chamber of the DarkSide-50 experiment with an exposure of (12306 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 184) kg d. The analysis is based on the ionization signal alone and significantly enhances the sensitivity of DarkSide-50, enabling sensitivity to dark matter with masses down to 40 MeV/c\$\^2\$. Furthermore, it sets the most stringent upper limit on the spin independent dark matter nucleon cross section for masses below \$3.6\$ GeV/c\$\^2\$.},

We describe the basic non-relativistic building blocks of operators and discuss their symmetry properties, writing down all Galilean-invariant operators up to quadratic order in momentum transfer arising from exchange of particles of spin 1 or less. Any DM particle theory can be translated into the coefficients of an effective operator and any effective operator can be simply related to most general description of the nuclear response. We find several operators which lead to novel nuclear responses. These responses differ significantly from the standard minimal WIMP cases in their relative coupling strengths to various elements, changing how the results from different experiments should be compared against each other. Response functions are evaluated for common DM targets - F, Na, Ge, I, and Xe - using standard shell model techniques. We point out that each of the nuclear responses is familiar from past studies of semi-leptonic electroweak interactions, and thus potentially testable in weak interaction studies. We provide tables of the full set of required matrix elements at finite momentum transfer for a range of common elements, making a careful and fully model-independent analysis possible. Finally, we discuss embedding non-relativistic effective theory operators into UV models of dark matter.},

From elastic scatterings on NS material, DM can get gravitationally trapped by the star. The cooling of DM through further collisions may lead to the formation of a dense core which could collapse into a black hole, thus destroying the whole NS. From the observation of old NS, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric DM. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of DM particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the DM density and energy profiles inside the NS, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, DM thermalizes with NS material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the DM-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of DM particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the DM-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic DM models; and (e) the use of realistic NS equations of state in determining these constraints.},

  abstract     = {Scatterings of galactic dark matter (DM) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped. DM particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range \$[10\^\{-10\} - 10\^2]\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$, for constant scattering cross sections and \$s\$-wave annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by \$E\_c/T\_\textbackslash chi \textbackslash sim 30\$, where \$E\_c\$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and \$T\_\textbackslash chi\$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm evap\} \textbackslash simeq 0.7\$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section, the DM evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range \$10\^\{-41\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2 \textbackslash leq \textbackslash sigma\_p \textbackslash leq 10\^\{-31\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2\$, where \$\textbackslash sigma\_p\$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity, or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.},

Conventional solutions require additional mechanisms for energy transport within the Sun. Vincent et al. have recently suggested that dark matter with a momentum or velocity dependent cross section could provide a solution. In this work, we consider three models of dark matter with such cross sections and their effect on the stellar structure. In particular, the three models incorporate dark matter particles interacting through an electromagnetic dipole moment: an electric dipole, a magnetic dipole or an anapole. Each model is implemented in the \textbackslash texttt\{DarkStec\} stellar evolution program, which incorporates the effects of dark matter capture and heat transport within the solar interior. We show that dark matter with an anapole moment of \$\textbackslash sim1\textbackslash mathrm\{GeV\}\^\{-2\}\$ or magnetic dipole moment of \$\textbackslash sim10\^\{-3\}\textbackslash mu\_p\$ can improve the sound-speed profile, small frequency separations and convective zone radius with respect to the Standard Solar Model. However, the required dipole moments are strongly excluded by direct detection experiments.},

We analyze models where the dark matter is a fermion or scalar interacting with quarks and/or gluons through an effective theory containing higher dimensional operators which represent heavier states that have been integrated out of the effective field theory. We determine bounds from existing Tevatron searches for monojets as well as expected LHC reaches for a discovery. We find that colliders can provide information which is complementary or in some cases even superior to experiments searching for direct detection of dark matter through its scattering with nuclei. In particular, both the Tevatron and the LHC can outperform spin dependent searches by an order of magnitude or better over much of parameter space, and if the dark matter couples mainly to gluons, the LHC can place bounds superior to any spin independent search.},

Capture by the earth is found to be significantly enhanced whenever the WIMP mass is roughly equal to the nuclear mass of an element present in the earth in large quantities. For Dirac neutrino WIMPs of mass 10-90 GeV, the capture rate is 10-300 times that previously believed. Capture rates for the sun are also recalculated and found to be from 1.5 times higher to 3 times lower than previously believed, depending on the mass and type of WIMP. The earth alone or the earth in combination with the sun is found to give a much stronger annihilation signal from Dirac neutrino WIMPs than the sun alone over a very large mass range. This is particularly important in the neighborhood of the mass of iron where previous analyses could not set any significant limits.},

First, an analytic approximation is made by defining an appropriate truncation of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the WIMPs and calculating the exact evaporation rate from this distribution due to interaction with a truly thermal distribution of nuclei. Then, the actual (nonthermal) distribution of Dirac neutrino WIMPs in the sun is calculated numerically for WIMPs of mass 1-7 GeV. Evaporation from the actual and thermal distributions is compared. It is found that the evaporation mass for a solar lifetime is 3.7 GeV, and for an 'annihilation lifetime', 2.9 GeV. These are about 8 percent lower than the most well-reasoned previous estimate.},

By means of a Monte Carlo integration of the Boltzmann collision equation, the energy transfer for simple model stars is computed and compared with an analytic approximation previously proposed by Press and Spergel (1985). The Press-Spergel approximation overestimates the energy transfer typically by a factor of a few. This factor is a sensitive function of radius, so that it is impossible to correct for it globally.},

We take into account dark matter interactions with baryonic matter and the time evolution of the dark matter sphere as it collapses within the neutron star. We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions. We show that for a dark matter density of \$\textasciitilde 10\^3\$ GeV/cm\$\^3\$ and dark matter mass \$m\_\textbackslash chi\$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for high dark matter density regions, we find that for \$m\_\textbackslash chi\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV when the dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-52\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ to \$10\^\{-57\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, the dark matter self-interaction cross section limit is \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\}{$<$} 10\^\{-33\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles is predicted to become gravitationally captured and accumulate in stars. While the subsequent annihilations of such particles lead to the injection of energy into stellar cores, elastically scattering dark matter particles do not generally yield enough energy to observably impact stellar phenomenology. Dark matter particles which scatter inelastically with nuclei (such that they reconcile the annual modulation reported by DAMA with the null results of CDMS and other experiments), however, can be captured by and annihilate in compact stars at a much higher rate. As a result, old white dwarf stars residing in high dark matter density environments can be prevented from cooling below several thousand degrees Kelvin. Observations of old, cool white dwarfs in dwarf spheroidal galaxies, or in the inner kiloparsec of the Milky Way, can thus potentially provide a valuable test of the inelastic dark matter hypothesis.},

  abstract     = {There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter capture and annihilation in the Sun can produce detectable high-energy neutrinos, providing a probe of the dark matter-proton scattering cross section. We consider the case when annihilation proceeds via long-lived dark mediators, which allows gamma rays to escape the Sun and reduces the attenuation of neutrinos. For gamma rays, there are exciting new opportunities, due to detailed measurements of GeV solar gamma rays with Fermi, and unprecedented sensitivities in the TeV range with HAWC and LHAASO. For neutrinos, the enhanced flux, particularly at higher energies (\$\textbackslash sim\$TeV), allows a more sensitive dark matter search with IceCube and KM3NeT. We show that these search channels can be extremely powerful, potentially improving sensitivity to the dark matter spin-dependent scattering cross section by several orders of magnitude relative to present searches for high-energy solar neutrinos, as well as direct detection experiments.},

  abstract      = {The LUX-ZEPLIN experiment is a dark matter detector centered on a dual-phase xenon time projection chamber operating at the Sanford Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota, USA. This Letter reports results from LUX-ZEPLIN's first search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) with an exposure of 60\textasciitilde live days using a fiducial mass of 5.5 t. A profile-likelihood ratio analysis shows the data to be consistent with a background-only hypothesis, setting new limits on spin-independent WIMP-nucleon, spin-dependent WIMP-neutron, and spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross sections for WIMP masses above 9 GeV/c\$\^2\$. The most stringent limit is set for spin-independent scattering at 36 GeV/c\$\^2\$, rejecting cross sections above 9.2\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-48\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ at the 90\% confidence level.},

We show that if the dark matter annihilates to standard-model particles then, under the assumption of primordial globular cluster formation, the observation of cold white dwarves in the globular cluster M4 appears inconsistent with explanations of the observed DAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal based on spin-independent inelastic dark matter scattering. Alternatively if the inelastic dark matter scenario were to be confirmed and it was found to annihilate to standard-model particles then this would imply a much lower dark matter density in the core of M4 than would be expected if it were to have formed in a dark matter halo. Finally we argue that cold white dwarves constitute a unique dark matter probe, complementary to other direct and indirect detection searches.},

Since dark matter does not self-annihilate in the ADM scenario, dark matter accumulates in neutron stars, eventually reaching the Chandrasekhar limit and forming a black hole. We focus on the case of scalar ADM, where the constraints from Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent black hole formation are most severe due to the absence of Fermi degeneracy pressure. We also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space, non-trivial effects from Hawking radiation can modify our limits. We find that for scalar ADM with mass between 100 keV and 10\^5 GeV, the constraint from pulsars in globular clusters on the scattering cross-section with neutrons ranges from \textbackslash sigma\_n {$<$} 10\^\{-45\} cm\^2 to 10\^\{-52\} cm\vphantom\{\}\^2. In particular, for scalar ADM with mass between 1 GeV and 1 TeV (in the case where black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation is unimportant), the constraint on the scattering cross-section is below what is reachable with ton scale direct detection experiments.},

We focus on models of dark matter interacting by the exchange of light vector gauge bosons that couple to a conserved dark charge. In these models, dark matter accumulated in neutron stars can extend to large radii and enhance their tidal polarizability. Gravitational waves detected from the first binary neutron star merger GW170817 places useful constraints on such not-so compact objects.

Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the last few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with 3 known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9-2.0 Msun mass range. For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

The additional luminosity coming from self-annihilations of dark matter particles captured inside the stars must not exceed the observed luminosity. Imposing that condition, we obtain for the spin independent cross section of light dark matter particles on baryons \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{N\textbackslash chi\}\$ the upper bound: \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{N\textbackslash chi\} {$<$} 4 \textbackslash times 10\^\{-41\}\{\textbackslash rm cm\^2\}\$.},

The chamber was operated at thermodynamic thresholds as low as 1.2 keV without loss of stability. A new blind 1404-kg-day exposure at 2.45 keV threshold was acquired with approximately the same expected total background rate as the previous 1167-kg-day exposure at 3.3 keV. This increased exposure is enabled in part by a new optical tracking analysis to better identify events near detector walls, permitting a larger fiducial volume. These results set the most stringent direct-detection constraint to date on the WIMP-proton spin-dependent cross section at 2.5 \$\textbackslash times\$ 10\$\^\{-41\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for a 25 GeV WIMP, and improve on previous PICO results for 3-5 GeV WIMPs by an order of magnitude.},

The number of particles which would be captured by the sun up to its present age by the capture mechanism of scattering off individual nucleons in the sun and into bound orbits is computed. For scattering cross sections not too far from the value of 4 x 10 to the -36th sq cm, which is optimal for suppressing solar neutrinos, it is found that just the right number can be captured. The solutions to the neutrino problem in the sun and the missing mass problem in the Galaxy may thus be one and the same.},

  abstract     = {The recent formulation of the relativistic Thomas-Fermi model within the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller theory for compressed atoms is applied to the study of general relativistic white dwarf equilibrium configurations. The equation of state, which takes into account the \textbackslash beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear, and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the simple formula \$\textbackslash sqrt\{g\_\{00\}\}\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$= constant, which links the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$ with the general relativistic gravitational potential \$g\_\{00\}\$ at each point of the configuration. The configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as inverse \textbackslash beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of \$\^4\$He, \$\^\{12\}\$C, \$\^\{16\}\$O and \$\^\{56\}\$Fe white dwarfs are presented. All these effects should be taken into account in processes requiring a precision knowledge of the white dwarf parameters.},

Here we explore how the neutrino background will affect future ton-scale experiments considering both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions. We show that combining data from experiments using different targets can improve the dark matter discovery potential due to target complementarity. We find that in the context of spin-dependent interactions, combining results from several targets can greatly enhance the subtraction of the neutrino background for WIMP masses below 10 GeV/c\$\^2\$ and therefore probe dark matter models to lower cross-sections. In the context of target complementarity, we also explore how one can tune the relative exposures of different target materials to optimize the WIMP discovery potential.},

  abstract     = {Dark matter charged under a new gauge sector, as motivated by recent data, suggests a rich GeV-scale "dark sector" weakly coupled to the Standard Model by gauge kinetic mixing. The new gauge bosons can decay to Standard Model leptons, but this mode is suppressed if decays into lighter dark sector particles are kinematically allowed. These particles in turn typically have macroscopic decay lifetimes that are constrained by two classes of experiments, which we discuss. Lifetimes of 10 cm {$<$} c tau {$<$} 10\^8 cm are constrained by existing terrestrial beam-dump experiments. If, in addition, dark matter captured in the Sun (or Earth) annihilates into these particles, lifetimes up to 10\^15 cm are constrained by solar observations. These bounds span fourteen orders of magnitude in lifetime, but they are not exhaustive. Accordingly, we identify promising new directions for experiments including searches for displaced di-muons in B-factories, studies at high-energy and -intensity proton beam dumps, precision gamma-ray and electronic measurements of the Sun, and milli-charge searches re-analyzed in this new context.},

Datasets from SKI-SKIII (3109.6 days) were used for the analysis. We looked for an excess of neutrino signal from the Sun as compared with the expected atmospheric neutrino background in three upmu categories: stopping, non-showering, and showering. No significant excess was observed. The 90\% C.L. upper limits of upward-going muon flux induced by WIMPs of 100 GeV/c\$\^2\$ were 6.4\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-15\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ sec\$\^\{-1\}\$ and 4.0\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-15\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ sec\$\^\{-1\}\$ for the soft and hard annihilation channels, respectively. These limits correspond to upper limits of 4.5\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-39\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ and 2.7\$\textbackslash times10\^\{-40\}\$ cm\$\^\{-2\}\$ for spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon scattering cross sections in the soft and hard annihilation channels, respectively.},

  abstract      = {Super-Kamiokande (SK) can search for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) by detecting neutrinos produced from WIMP annihilations occurring inside the Sun. In this analysis, we include neutrino events with interaction vertices in the detector in addition to upward-going muons produced in the surrounding rock. Compared to the previous result, which used the upward-going muons only, the signal acceptances for light (few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ \$\textbackslash sim\$ 200-GeV/\$c\^2\$) WIMPs are significantly increased. We fit 3903 days of SK data to search for the contribution of neutrinos from WIMP annihilation in the Sun. We found no significant excess over expected atmospheric-neutrino background and the result is interpreted in terms of upper limits on WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross sections under different assumptions about the annihilation channel. We set the current best limits on the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-proton cross section for WIMP masses below 200 GeV/\$c\^2\$ (at 10 GeV/\$c\^2\$, 1.49\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-39\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow b \textbackslash bar\{b\}\$ and 1.31\$\textbackslash times 10\^\{-40\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ for \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\textbackslash rightarrow\textbackslash tau\^+\textbackslash tau\^-\$ annihilation channels), also ruling out some fraction of WIMP candidates with spin-independent (SI) coupling in the few-GeV/\$c\^2\$ mass range.},

  abstract     = {We use the formalism of Gould and Raffelt to compute the dimensionless thermal conduction coefficients for scattering of dark matter particles with standard model nucleons via cross-sections that depend on the relative velocity or momentum exchanged between particles. Motivated by models invoked to reconcile various recent results in direct detection, we explicitly compute the conduction coefficients \$\textbackslash alpha\$ and \$\textbackslash kappa\$ for cross-sections that go as \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^2\$, \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^4\$, \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^\{-2\}\$, \$q\^2\$, \$q\^4\$ and \$q\^\{-2\}\$, where \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\$ is the relative DM-nucleus velocity and \$q\$ is the momentum transferred in the collision. We find that a \$v\_\{\textbackslash rm rel\}\^\{-2\}\$ dependence can significantly enhance energy transport from the inner solar core to the outer core. The same can true for any \$q\$-dependent coupling, if the dark matter mass lies within some specific range for each coupling. This effect can complement direct searches for dark matter; combining these results with state-of-the-art Solar simulations should greatly increase sensitivity to certain DM models. It also seems possible that the so-called Solar Abundance Problem could be resolved by enhanced energy transport in the solar core due to such velocity- or momentum-dependent scatterings.},

We develop a variety of novel techniques to limit the resulting increase in backgrounds near the threshold. No significant \$\^8\$B neutrino-like excess is found in an exposure of 0.6 t \$\textbackslash times\$ y. For the first time, we use the non-detection of solar neutrinos to constrain the light yield from 1-2 keV nuclear recoils in liquid xenon, as well as non-standard neutrino-quark interactions. Finally, we improve upon world-leading constraints on dark matter-nucleus interactions for dark matter masses between 3 GeV/c\$\^2\$ and 11 GeV/c\$\^2\$ by as much as an order of magnitude.},
