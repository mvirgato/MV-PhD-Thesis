	abstract = {The paper analyzes the evaporation of weakly interacting massive particles ({WIMPs}) from the sun, both analytically and numerically. First, an analytic approximation is made by defining an appropriate truncation of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the {WIMPs} and calculating the exact evaporation rate from this distribution due to interaction with a truly thermal distribution of nuclei. Then, the actual (nonthermal) distribution of Dirac neutrino {WIMPs} in the sun is calculated numerically for {WIMPs} of mass 1-7 {GeV}. Evaporation from the actual and thermal distributions is compared. It is found that the evaporation mass for a solar lifetime is 3.7 {GeV}, and for an 'annihilation lifetime', 2.9 {GeV}. These are about 8 percent lower than the most well-reasoned previous estimate.},
