  abstract = {We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.},

  abstract = {We estimate the long-lasting gravitational wave (GW) emission of compact dark objects following a binary neutron-star (NS) merger. We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range of a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the orbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find relations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the assumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the GW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM component. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM components in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M\_sun. We emphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant. A forming black hole will immediately swallow the DM objects because their orbits are smaller than the innermost stable circular orbit of the black hole.},

If non-annihilating dark matter is captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

Dark matter can be captured by neutron stars via scattering, where kinetic energy is transferred to the star. This can have a number of observational consequences, such as the heating of old neutron stars to infra-red temperatures. Previous treatments of the capture process have employed various approximation or simplifications. We present here an improved treatment of dark matter capture, valid for a wide dark matter mass range, that correctly incorporates all relevant physical effects. These include gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli blocking, neutron star opacity and multi-scattering effects. We provide general expressions that enable the exact capture rate to be calculated numerically, and derive simplified expressions that are valid for particular interaction types or mass regimes and that greatly increase the computational efficiency. Our formalism is applicable to the scattering of dark matter from any neutron star constituents, or to the capture of dark matter in other compact objects.},

We recently developed an improved treatment of dark matter (DM) capture in neutron stars that properly incorporates many of the important physical effects, and outlined useful analytic approximations that are valid when the scattering amplitude is independent of the centre of mass energy. We now extend that analysis to all interaction types. We also discuss the effect of going beyond the zero-temperature approximation, which provides a boost to the capture rate of low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter from leptonic targets, for which a correct relativistic description is essential. We find that the potential neutron star sensitivity to DM-lepton scattering cross sections greatly exceeds electron-recoil experiments, particularly in the sub-GeV regime, with a sensitivity to sub-MeV DM well beyond the reach of future terrestrial experiments.},

  abstract = {White dwarfs, the most abundant stellar remnants, provide a promising means of probing dark matter (DM) interactions, complimentary to terrestrial searches. The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to gravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In particular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark matter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of captured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on either the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions, we account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form factors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects pertinent to sub-GeV dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic, degenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple scattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter evaporation rate. The DM-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be constrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with observations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply this technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster Messier 4, which we assume to be located in a DM subhalo. For DM-nucleon scattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-GeV mass range inaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only by either evaporation or dominant DM annihilation to neutrinos, and can be competitive with direct detection in the \$1-10\^4\$ GeV range. White dwarf limits on dark matter-electron scattering are found to outperform current electron recoil experiments over the full mass range considered, and extend well beyond the \$\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV mass regime where the sensitivity of electron recoil experiments is reduced.},

In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than \$1\$ year for vector interactions and \$10\^4\$ years for scalar interactions.},

Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars, the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example, a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities \$c\_s\^2 {$>$} 0.1\$ in the cores of 2.1 solar-mass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak first-order phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range \$\textbackslash Delta\textbackslash rho/\textbackslash rho {$<$} 0.2\$ (at 68\% level) in a Maxwell construction turn out to be still possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter. In view of these data-based constraints, much discussed issues such as the quest for a phase transition towards restored chiral symmetry, and the active degrees of freedom in cold and dense baryonic matter, are reexamined.},

The best-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5 GeV. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun can be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of such models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the first time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions, thermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically thin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that depending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass below which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 GeV. This has the effect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance Problem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also provide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account thermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly matched to the well-known saturation limit.},

Accretion of particle dark matter (DM) by such NS can heat them up through kinetic and annihilation processes. This increases the NS surface temperature to a maximum of \$\textbackslash sim 2550\$ K in the best case scenario. The maximum accretion rate depends on the DM ambient density and velocity dispersion, and on the NS equation of state and their velocity distributions. Upon scanning over these variables, we find that the effective surface temperature varies at most by \$\textbackslash sim 40\textbackslash\%\$. Black body spectrum of such warm NS peak at near infrared wavelengths with magnitudes in the range potentially detectable by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Using the JWST exposure time calculator, we demonstrate that NS with surface temperatures \$\textbackslash gtrsim 2400\$ K, located at a distance of 10 pc can be detected through the F150W2 (F322W2) filters of the NIRCAM instrument at SNR \$\textbackslash gtrsim 10\$ (5) within 24 hours of exposure time. Independently of DM, an observation of NS with surface temperatures \$\textbackslash gtrsim 2500\$ K will be a formative step towards testing the minimal cooling paradigm during late evolutionary stages.},

Both DM species \$\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\$ with masses heavier than 1 GeV are considered. In this picture, both species could be captured by the Sun through DM-nucleus scattering and DM self-scatterings, e.g. \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\textbackslash xi\$ collisions. In addition, the heterogeneous self-scattering due to \$\textbackslash chi\$ and \$\textbackslash xi\$ collision is essentially possible in any 2DM models. This new introduced scattering naturally weaves the evolution processes of the two DM species that was assumed to evolve independently. Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of DM being captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range of DM mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the solar-captured DM annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the DM indirect detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution in the Sun as well as its kinematics are studied.},

Its energy is then transferred to the neutron star as heat through the scattering and annihilation inside the star. This heating effect may be detectable via dedicated temperature observations of nearby old pulsars, providing an alternative method for dark matter searches. In this paper, we show that for electroweak multiplet dark matter this search strategy can probe the parameter region which is out of reach of future dark matter direct detection experiments. To see this systematically, we classify such dark matter candidates in terms of their electroweak charges and investigate the effect of ultraviolet physics by means of higher-dimensional effective operators. We then show that if the effect of ultraviolet physics is sizable, the dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering cross section becomes sufficiently large, whilst if it is suppressed, then the mass splittings among the components of the DM multiplet get small enough so that the inelastic scattering processes are operative. In any case, the electroweak multiplet dark matter particles are efficiently captured in neutron stars, making the search strategy with the temperature observation of old neutron stars promising.},

From elastic scatterings on NS material, DM can get gravitationally trapped by the star. The cooling of DM through further collisions may lead to the formation of a dense core which could collapse into a black hole, thus destroying the whole NS. From the observation of old NS, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric DM. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of DM particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the DM density and energy profiles inside the NS, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, DM thermalizes with NS material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the DM-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of DM particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the DM-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic DM models; and (e) the use of realistic NS equations of state in determining these constraints.},

  abstract = {Scatterings of galactic dark matter (DM) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that DM particles must have in order to remain trapped. DM particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range \$[10\^\{-10\} - 10\^2]\textasciitilde M\_\textbackslash odot\$, for constant scattering cross sections and \$s\$-wave annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the DM evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by \$E\_c/T\_\textbackslash chi \textbackslash sim 30\$, where \$E\_c\$ is the escape energy of DM particles at the core of the object and \$T\_\textbackslash chi\$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the DM evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, \$m\_\{\textbackslash rm evap\} \textbackslash simeq 0.7\$ GeV. For other values of the scattering cross section, the DM evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range \$10\^\{-41\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2 \textbackslash leq \textbackslash sigma\_p \textbackslash leq 10\^\{-31\}\textasciitilde\textbackslash textrm\{cm\}\^2\$, where \$\textbackslash sigma\_p\$ is the spin-independent DM-nucleon scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic DM density and velocity, or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.},

We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions. We show that for a dark matter density of \$\textasciitilde 10\^3\$ GeV/cm\$\^3\$ and dark matter mass \$m\_\textbackslash chi\$ less than approximately 10 GeV, there is a potential exclusion region for dark matter interactions with nucleons that is three orders of magnitude more stringent than without self-interactions. The potential exclusion region for dark matter self-interaction cross sections is many orders of magnitude stronger than the current Bullet Cluster limit. For example, for high dark matter density regions, we find that for \$m\_\textbackslash chi\textbackslash sim 10\$ GeV when the dark matter interaction cross section with the nucleons ranges from \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi n\}\textbackslash sim 10\^\{-52\}\$ cm\$\^2\$ to \$10\^\{-57\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, the dark matter self-interaction cross section limit is \$\textbackslash sigma\_\{\textbackslash chi\textbackslash chi\}{$<$} 10\^\{-33\}\$ cm\$\^2\$, which is about ten orders of magnitude stronger than the Bullet Cluster limit.},

Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPS in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

We impose constraints competitive to direct dark matter search experiments, for WIMPs with masses down to the TeV scale.},

Several recent observational and theoretical developments provide powerful constraints on their structure and internal composition. Among these are the first observed binary neutron star merger, GW170817, whose gravitational radiation was accompanied by electromagnetic radiation from a short {$\gamma$}-ray burst and an optical afterglow believed to be due to the radioactive decay of newly minted heavy r-process nuclei. These observations give important constraints on the radii of typical neutron stars and on the upper limit to the neutron star maximum mass and complement recent pulsar observations that established a lower limit. Pulse-profile observations by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) X-ray telescope provide an independent, consistent measure of the neutron star radius. Theoretical many-body studies of neutron matter reinforce these estimates of neutron star radii. Studies using parameterized dense matter equations of state (EOSs) reveal several EOS-independent relations connecting global neutron star properties.},

  abstract = {Using neutron stars (NS) as a dark matter (DM) probe has gained broad attention recently, either from heating due to DM annihilation or its stability under the presence of DM. In this work, we investigate spin-\$1/2\$ fermionic DM \$\textbackslash chi\$ charged under the \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson \$V\$ of \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ gauge group can be produced in NS via DM annihilation. The produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model (SM) particles before it exits the NS, despite its tiny couplings to SM particles. Thus, we perform a systematic study on \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2V\textbackslash to4\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ as a new heating mechanism for NS in addition to \$\textbackslash chi\textbackslash bar\{\textbackslash chi\}\textbackslash to2\{\textbackslash rm SM\}\$ and kinetic heating from DM-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to \$\textbackslash chi V\$ scattering is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass mixing terms between \$V\$ and SM gauge bosons are present. This allows both vector and axial-vector couplings between \$V\$ and SM fermions even for \$m\_V\textbackslash ll m\_Z\$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches to DM-induced NS heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses. Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the NS surface temperature by the future telescopes are discussed as well.},

Since dark matter does not self-annihilate in the ADM scenario, dark matter accumulates in neutron stars, eventually reaching the Chandrasekhar limit and forming a black hole. We focus on the case of scalar ADM, where the constraints from Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent black hole formation are most severe due to the absence of Fermi degeneracy pressure. We also note that in some portions of this constrained parameter space, non-trivial effects from Hawking radiation can modify our limits. We find that for scalar ADM with mass between 100 keV and 10\^5 GeV, the constraint from pulsars in globular clusters on the scattering cross-section with neutrons ranges from \textbackslash sigma\_n {$<$} 10\^\{-45\} cm\^2 to 10\^\{-52\} cm\vphantom\{\}\^2. In particular, for scalar ADM with mass between 1 GeV and 1 TeV (in the case where black hole evaporation due to Hawking radiation is unimportant), the constraint on the scattering cross-section is below what is reachable with ton scale direct detection experiments.},

For radii, large, high quality datasets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 9.9-11.2 km range and shrinking their uncertainties due to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive neutron star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

More specifically, exploiting the recent observation of the GW event GW 170817 and drawing from basic arguments on kilonova modeling of GRB 170817A, together with the quasi-universal relation between the maximum mass of nonrotating stellar models \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm TOV\}\$ and the maximum mass supported through uniform rotation \$M\_\{\textbackslash rm max\}=\textbackslash left(1.20\^\{+0.02\}\_\{-0.05\}\textbackslash right) M\_\{\textbackslash rm TOV\}\$ we set limits for the maximum mass to be \$ 2.01\^\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.04\}\textbackslash leq M\_\{\textbackslash rm TOV\}/M\_\{\textbackslash odot\}\textbackslash lesssim 2.16\^\{+0.17\}\_\{-0.15\}\$, where the lower limit in this range comes from pulsar observations. Our estimate, which follows a very simple line of arguments and does not rely on the modeling of the electromagnetic signal in terms of numerical simulations, can be further refined as new detections become available. We briefly discuss the impact that our conclusions have on the equation of state of nuclear matter.},

  abstract = {The recent formulation of the relativistic Thomas-Fermi model within the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller theory for compressed atoms is applied to the study of general relativistic white dwarf equilibrium configurations. The equation of state, which takes into account the \textbackslash beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear, and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the simple formula \$\textbackslash sqrt\{g\_\{00\}\}\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$= constant, which links the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell \$\textbackslash mu\_\{\textbackslash rm ws\}\$ with the general relativistic gravitational potential \$g\_\{00\}\$ at each point of the configuration. The configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as inverse \textbackslash beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of \$\^4\$He, \$\^\{12\}\$C, \$\^\{16\}\$O and \$\^\{56\}\$Fe white dwarfs are presented. All these effects should be taken into account in processes requiring a precision knowledge of the white dwarf parameters.},

The subject is rich in many different areas of physics accessible to a junior or senior physics major, ranging from thermodynamics to quantum statistics to nuclear physics to special and general relativity. The computations for solving the coupled structure differential equations (both Newtonian and general relativistic) can be done using a symbolic computational package, such as Mathematica. In doing so, the student will develop computational skills and learn how to deal with dimensions. Along the way he or she will also have learned some of the physics of equations of state and of degenerate stars.},

  abstract = {Probing the existence of hypothetical particles beyond the Standard model often deals with extreme parameters: large energies, tiny cross-sections, large time scales, etc. Sometimes laboratory experiments can test required regions of parameter space, but more often natural limitations leads to poorly restrictive upper limits. In such cases astrophysical studies can help to expand the range of values significantly. Among astronomical sources, used in interests of fundamental physics, compact objects -- neutron stars and white dwarfs, -- play a leading role. We review several aspects of astroparticle physics studies related to observations and properties of these celestial bodies. Dark matter particles can be collected inside compact objects resulting in additional heating or collapse. We summarize regimes and rates of particle capturing as well as possible astrophysical consequences. Then we focus on a particular type of hypothetical particles -- axions. Their existence can be uncovered due to observations of emission originated due to Primakoff process in magnetospheres of neutron stars or white dwarfs. Alternatively, they can contribute to cooling of these compact objects. We present results in these areas, including upper limits based on recent observations.},
