	abstract = {This paper describes the 2018 Planck {CMB} likelihoods, following a hybrid approach similar to the 2015 one, with different approximations at low and high multipoles, and implementing several methodological and analysis refinements. With more realistic simulations, and better correction and modelling of systematics, we can now make full use of the High Frequency Instrument polarization data. The low-multipole 100x143 {GHz} {EE} cross-spectrum constrains the reionization optical-depth parameter \${\textbackslash}tau\$ to better than 15\% (in combination with with the other low- and high-\${\textbackslash}ell\$ likelihoods). We also update the 2015 baseline low-\${\textbackslash}ell\$ joint {TEB} likelihood based on the Low Frequency Instrument data, which provides a weaker \${\textbackslash}tau\$ constraint. At high multipoles, a better model of the temperature-to-polarization leakage and corrections for the effective calibrations of the polarization channels (polarization efficiency or {PE}) allow us to fully use the polarization spectra, improving the constraints on the \${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} parameters by 20 to 30\% compared to {TT}-only constraints. Tests on the modelling of the polarization demonstrate good consistency, with some residual modelling uncertainties, the accuracy of the {PE} modelling being the main limitation. Using our various tests, simulations, and comparison between different high-\${\textbackslash}ell\$ implementations, we estimate the consistency of the results to be better than the 0.5\${\textbackslash}sigma\$ level. Minor curiosities already present before (differences between \${\textbackslash}ell\${\textless}800 and \${\textbackslash}ell\${\textgreater}800 parameters or the preference for more smoothing of the \$C\_{\textbackslash}ell\$ peaks) are shown to be driven by the {TT} power spectrum and are not significantly modified by the inclusion of polarization. Overall, the legacy Planck {CMB} likelihoods provide a robust tool for constraining the cosmological model and represent a reference for future {CMB} observations. (Abridged)},

We derive [3.6] surface photometry and study structural relations of stellar and gas disks. We find that both the stellar mass-{HI} mass relation and the stellar radius-{HI} radius relation have significant intrinsic scatter, while the {HI} mass-radius relation is extremely tight. We build detailed mass models and quantify the ratio of baryonic-to-observed velocity (Vbar/Vobs) for different characteristic radii and values of the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L) at [3.6]. Assuming M/L=0.5 Msun/Lsun (as suggested by stellar population models) we find that (i) the gas fraction linearly correlates with total luminosity, (ii) the transition from star-dominated to gas-dominated galaxies roughly corresponds to the transition from spiral galaxies to dwarf irregulars in line with density wave theory; and (iii) Vbar/Vobs varies with luminosity and surface brightness: high-mass, high-surface-brightness galaxies are nearly maximal, while low-mass, low-surface-brightness galaxies are submaximal. These basic properties are lost for low values of M/L=0.2 Msun/Lsun as suggested by the {DiskMass} survey. The mean maximum-disk limit in bright galaxies is M/L=0.7 Msun/Lsun at [3.6].

A combined analysis gives dark matter density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_c h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.120{\textbackslash}pm 0.001\$, baryon density \${\textbackslash}Omega\_b h{\textasciicircum}2 = 0.0224{\textbackslash}pm 0.0001\$, scalar spectral index \$n\_s = 0.965{\textbackslash}pm 0.004\$, and optical depth \${\textbackslash}tau = 0.054{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$ (in this abstract we quote \$68{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ confidence regions on measured parameters and \$95{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ on upper limits). The angular acoustic scale is measured to \$0.03{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\%\$ precision, with \$100{\textbackslash}theta\_*=1.0411{\textbackslash}pm 0.0003\$. These results are only weakly dependent on the cosmological model and remain stable, with somewhat increased errors, in many commonly considered extensions. Assuming the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} cosmology, the inferred late-Universe parameters are: Hubble constant \$H\_0 = (67.4{\textbackslash}pm 0.5)\$km/s/Mpc; matter density parameter \${\textbackslash}Omega\_m = 0.315{\textbackslash}pm 0.007\$; and matter fluctuation amplitude \${\textbackslash}sigma\_8 = 0.811{\textbackslash}pm 0.006\$. We find no compelling evidence for extensions to the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model. Combining with {BAO} we constrain the effective extra relativistic degrees of freedom to be \$N\_\{{\textbackslash}rm eff\} = 2.99{\textbackslash}pm 0.17\$, and the neutrino mass is tightly constrained to \${\textbackslash}sum m\_{\textbackslash}nu{\textless} 0.12\${eV}. The {CMB} spectra continue to prefer higher lensing amplitudes than predicted in base -\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} at over \$2{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}sigma\$, which pulls some parameters that affect the lensing amplitude away from the base-\${\textbackslash}Lambda\${CDM} model; however, this is not supported by the lensing reconstruction or (in models that also change the background geometry) {BAO} data.

Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

	abstract = {White dwarfs, the most abundant stellar remnants, provide a promising means of probing dark matter ({DM}) interactions, complimentary to terrestrial searches. The scattering of dark matter from stellar constituents leads to gravitational capture, with important observational consequences. In particular, white dwarf heating occurs due to the energy transfer in the dark matter capture and thermalisation processes, and the subsequent annihilation of captured dark matter. We consider the capture of dark matter by scattering on either the ion or the degenerate electron component of white dwarfs. For ions, we account for the stellar structure, the star opacity, realistic nuclear form factors that go beyond the simple Helm approach, and finite temperature effects pertinent to sub-{GeV} dark matter. Electrons are treated as relativistic, degenerate targets, with Pauli blocking, finite temperature and multiple scattering effects all taken into account. We also estimate the dark matter evaporation rate. The {DM}-nucleon/electron scattering cross sections can be constrained by comparing the heating rate due to dark matter capture with observations of cold white dwarfs in dark matter-rich environments. We apply this technique to observations of old white dwarfs in the globular cluster Messier 4, which we assume to be located in a {DM} subhalo. For {DM}-nucleon scattering, we find that white dwarfs can probe the sub-{GeV} mass range inaccessible to direct detection searches, with the low mass reach limited only by either evaporation or dominant {DM} annihilation to neutrinos, and can be competitive with direct detection in the \$1-10{\textasciicircum}4\$ {GeV} range. White dwarf limits on dark matter-electron scattering are found to outperform current electron recoil experiments over the full mass range considered, and extend well beyond the \${\textbackslash}sim 10\$ {GeV} mass regime where the sensitivity of electron recoil experiments is reduced.},

We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the {DM} capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where {DM} scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected {DM}-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide {DM} mass range.},

We now extend that analysis to all interaction types. We also discuss the effect of going beyond the zero-temperature approximation, which provides a boost to the capture rate of low mass dark matter, and give approximations for the dark matter up-scattering rate and evaporation mass. We apply these results to scattering of dark matter from leptonic targets, for which a correct relativistic description is essential. We find that the potential neutron star sensitivity to {DM}-lepton scattering cross sections greatly exceeds electron-recoil experiments, particularly in the sub-{GeV} regime, with a sensitivity to sub-{MeV} {DM} well beyond the reach of future terrestrial experiments.},

	abstract = {Neutron stars provide a cosmic laboratory to study the nature of dark matter particles and their interactions. Dark matter can be captured by neutron stars via scattering, where kinetic energy is transferred to the star. This can have a number of observational consequences, such as the heating of old neutron stars to infra-red temperatures. Previous treatments of the capture process have employed various approximation or simplifications. We present here an improved treatment of dark matter capture, valid for a wide dark matter mass range, that correctly incorporates all relevant physical effects. These include gravitational focusing, a fully relativistic scattering treatment, Pauli blocking, neutron star opacity and multi-scattering effects. We provide general expressions that enable the exact capture rate to be calculated numerically, and derive simplified expressions that are valid for particular interaction types or mass regimes and that greatly increase the computational efficiency. Our formalism is applicable to the scattering of dark matter from any neutron star constituents, or to the capture of dark matter in other compact objects.},

First, an analytic approximation is made by defining an appropriate truncation of a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the {WIMPs} and calculating the exact evaporation rate from this distribution due to interaction with a truly thermal distribution of nuclei. Then, the actual (nonthermal) distribution of Dirac neutrino {WIMPs} in the sun is calculated numerically for {WIMPs} of mass 1-7 {GeV}. Evaporation from the actual and thermal distributions is compared. It is found that the evaporation mass for a solar lifetime is 3.7 {GeV}, and for an 'annihilation lifetime', 2.9 {GeV}. These are about 8 percent lower than the most well-reasoned previous estimate.},

Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly-interacting massive particle ({WIMP}). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect {WIMPS} in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of {WIMPs} that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many {WIMP} candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculation. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

We show that dark matter self-interactions play an important role in the rapid accumulation of dark matter in the core of the neutron star. We consider the possibility of determining an exclusion region of the parameter space for dark matter mass and dark matter interaction cross sections based on the observation of old neutron stars with strong dark matter self-interactions.

If non-annihilating dark matter is captured by neutron stars, the density will eventually become sufficient for black hole formation. However, the dynamics of collapse is highly sensitive to dark-matter self-interactions. Repulsive self-interactions, even if extremely weak, can prevent black hole formation. We argue that self-interactions will necessarily be present, and estimate their strength in representative models. We also consider co-annihilation of dark matter with nucleons, which arises naturally in many asymmetric dark matter models, and which again acts to prevent black hole formation. We demonstrate how the excluded region of the dark-matter parameter space shrinks as the strength of such interactions is increased, and conclude that neutron star observations do not exclude most realistic bosonic asymmetric dark matter models.},

	abstract = {Scatterings of galactic dark matter ({DM}) particles with the constituents of celestial bodies could result in their accumulation within these objects. Nevertheless, the finite temperature of the medium sets a minimum mass, the evaporation mass, that {DM} particles must have in order to remain trapped. {DM} particles below this mass are very likely to scatter to speeds higher than the escape velocity, so they would be kicked out of the capturing object and escape. Here, we compute the {DM} evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium, spanning the mass range \$[10{\textasciicircum}\{-10\} - 10{\textasciicircum}2]{\textasciitilde}M\_{\textbackslash}odot\$, for constant scattering cross sections and \$s\$-wave annihilations. We illustrate the critical importance of the exponential tail of the evaporation rate, which has not always been appreciated in recent literature, and obtain a robust result: for the geometric value of the scattering cross section and for interactions with nucleons, at the local galactic position, the {DM} evaporation mass for all spherical celestial bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium is approximately given by \$E\_c/T\_{\textbackslash}chi {\textbackslash}sim 30\$, where \$E\_c\$ is the escape energy of {DM} particles at the core of the object and \$T\_{\textbackslash}chi\$ is their temperature. In that case, the minimum value of the {DM} evaporation mass is obtained for super-Jupiters and brown dwarfs, \$m\_\{{\textbackslash}rm evap\} {\textbackslash}simeq 0.7\$ {GeV}. For other values of the scattering cross section, the {DM} evaporation mass only varies by a factor smaller than three within the range \$10{\textasciicircum}\{-41\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}textrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}sigma\_p {\textbackslash}leq 10{\textasciicircum}\{-31\}{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}textrm\{cm\}{\textasciicircum}2\$, where \${\textbackslash}sigma\_p\$ is the spin-independent {DM}-nucleon scattering cross section. Its dependence on parameters such as the galactic {DM} density and velocity, or the scattering and annihilation cross sections is only logarithmic, and details on the density and temperature profiles of celestial bodies have also a small impact.},

From elastic scatterings on {NS} material, {DM} can get gravitationally trapped by the star. The cooling of {DM} through further collisions may lead to the formation of a dense core which could collapse into a black hole, thus destroying the whole {NS}. From the observation of old {NS}, such a scenario leads to very stringent constraints on the parameter space of asymmetric {DM}. In this work we reexamine this possibility in detail. This includes: (a) a new detailed determination of the number of {DM} particles captured, properly taking into account the fact that neutrons form a highly degenerate Fermi material; (b) the determination of the time evolution of the {DM} density and energy profiles inside the {NS}, which allows us to understand how, as a function of time, {DM} thermalizes with {NS} material; (c) the determination of the corresponding constraints which hold on the {DM}-neutron cross section, including for the case where a large fraction of {DM} particles have not thermalized; (d) the first determination of the stringent constraints which also hold in a similar way on the {DM}-muon cross section, particularly relevant for leptophilic {DM} models; and (e) the use of realistic {NS} equations of state in determining these constraints.},

We consider compact dark objects, which initially reside in the centers of {NSs} and which may consist of self-interacting dark matter ({DM}). By approximating the compact dark objects as test particles, we model the merging of {NS} binaries hosting {DM} components with three-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that the {DM} components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger remnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital motion of the {DM} components generates a {GW} signal with frequencies in the range of a few {kHz}. When considering a range of different binary masses and high-density equations of state ({EoS}), we find that the {GW} frequency of the orbiting {DM} components scales with the compactness of {NSs}. Similarly, we find relations between the {DM} {GW} frequency and the dominant postmerger {GW} frequency of the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies {EoS} effects during the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be used to specify the frequency range of the {GW} emission by {DM}. Under the assumption that {GW} back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the {GW} signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the {DM} component. We estimate the detectability of the {GW} signals and find that {DM} components in {NS} mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected {GW} instruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M\_sun. We emphasize that the {GW} emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant.

	abstract = {Using neutron stars ({NS}) as a dark matter ({DM}) probe has gained broad attention recently, either from heating due to {DM} annihilation or its stability under the presence of {DM}. In this work, we investigate spin-\$1/2\$ fermionic {DM} \${\textbackslash}chi\$ charged under the \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ in the dark sector. The massive gauge boson \$V\$ of \$U(1)\_\{X\}\$ gauge group can be produced in {NS} via {DM} annihilation. The produced gauge boson can decay into Standard Model ({SM}) particles before it exits the {NS}, despite its tiny couplings to {SM} particles. Thus, we perform a systematic study on \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}chi\}{\textbackslash}to2V{\textbackslash}to4\{{\textbackslash}rm {SM}\}\$ as a new heating mechanism for {NS} in addition to \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}bar\{{\textbackslash}chi\}{\textbackslash}to2\{{\textbackslash}rm {SM}\}\$ and kinetic heating from {DM}-baryon scattering. The self-trapping due to \${\textbackslash}chi V\$ scattering is also considered. We assume the general framework that both kinetic and mass mixing terms between \$V\$ and {SM} gauge bosons are present. This allows both vector and axial-vector couplings between \$V\$ and {SM} fermions even for \$m\_V{\textbackslash}ll m\_Z\$. Notably, the contribution from axial-vector coupling is not negligible when particles scatter relativistically. We point out that the above approaches to {DM}-induced {NS} heating are not yet adopted in recent analyses. Detectabilities of the aforementioned effects to the {NS} surface temperature by the future telescopes are discussed as well.},

Both {DM} species \${\textbackslash}chi\$ and \${\textbackslash}xi\$ with masses heavier than 1 {GeV} are considered. In this picture, both species could be captured by the Sun through {DM}-nucleus scattering and {DM} self-scatterings, e.g. \${\textbackslash}chi{\textbackslash}chi\$ and \${\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}xi\$ collisions. In addition, the heterogeneous self-scattering due to \${\textbackslash}chi\$ and \${\textbackslash}xi\$ collision is essentially possible in any 2DM models. This new introduced scattering naturally weaves the evolution processes of the two {DM} species that was assumed to evolve independently. Moreover, the heterogeneous self-scattering enhances the number of {DM} being captured in the Sun mutually. This effect significantly exists in a broad range of {DM} mass spectrum. We have studied this phenomena and its implication for the solar-captured {DM} annihilation rate. It would be crucial to the {DM} indirect detection when the two masses are close. General formalism of the 2DM evolution in the Sun as well as its kinematics are studied.},

In such cases astrophysical studies can help to expand the range of values significantly. Among astronomical sources, used in interests of fundamental physics, compact objects -- neutron stars and white dwarfs, -- play a leading role. We review several aspects of astroparticle physics studies related to observations and properties of these celestial bodies. Dark matter particles can be collected inside compact objects resulting in additional heating or collapse. We summarize regimes and rates of particle capturing as well as possible astrophysical consequences. Then we focus on a particular type of hypothetical particles -- axions. Their existence can be uncovered due to observations of emission originated due to Primakoff process in magnetospheres of neutron stars or white dwarfs. Alternatively, they can contribute to cooling of these compact objects. We present results in these areas, including upper limits based on recent observations.},

Its energy is then transferred to the neutron star as heat through the scattering and annihilation inside the star. This heating effect may be detectable via dedicated temperature observations of nearby old pulsars, providing an alternative method for dark matter searches. In this paper, we show that for electroweak multiplet dark matter this search strategy can probe the parameter region which is out of reach of future dark matter direct detection experiments. To see this systematically, we classify such dark matter candidates in terms of their electroweak charges and investigate the effect of ultraviolet physics by means of higher-dimensional effective operators. We then show that if the effect of ultraviolet physics is sizable, the dark matter-nucleon elastic scattering cross section becomes sufficiently large, whilst if it is suppressed, then the mass splittings among the components of the {DM} multiplet get small enough so that the inelastic scattering processes are operative. In any case, the electroweak multiplet dark matter particles are efficiently captured in neutron stars, making the search strategy with the temperature observation of old neutron stars promising.},

Capture rates for the sun are also recalculated and found to be from 1.5 times higher to 3 times lower than previously believed, depending on the mass and type of {WIMP}.

Rotation increases the value of M\_min: at rotation period of 10 ms the minimum mass of neutron stars increases to 0.13 M\_sun, and corresponds to the mass-shedding (Keplerian) configuration. In the case of the shortest observed rotation period of radio pulsars 1.56 ms, minimum mass of uniformly rotating cold neutron stars corresponds to the mass-shedding limit, and is found at 0.61 M\_sun for the {SLy} {EOS} and 0.54 M\_sun for the {FPS} {EOS}.},

	abstract = {The recent formulation of the relativistic Thomas-Fermi model within the Feynman-Metropolis-Teller theory for compressed atoms is applied to the study of general relativistic white dwarf equilibrium configurations. The equation of state, which takes into account the {\textbackslash}beta-equilibrium, the nuclear and the Coulomb interactions between the nuclei and the surrounding electrons, is obtained as a function of the compression by considering each atom constrained in a Wigner-Seitz cell. The contribution of quantum statistics, weak, nuclear, and electromagnetic interactions is obtained by the determination of the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell. The further contribution of the general relativistic equilibrium of white dwarf matter is expressed by the simple formula \${\textbackslash}sqrt\{g\_\{00\}\}{\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ws\}\$= constant, which links the chemical potential of the Wigner-Seitz cell \${\textbackslash}mu\_\{{\textbackslash}rm ws\}\$ with the general relativistic gravitational potential \$g\_\{00\}\$ at each point of the configuration. The configuration outside each Wigner-Seitz cell is strictly neutral and therefore no global electric field is necessary to warranty the equilibrium of the white dwarf. These equations modify the ones used by Chandrasekhar by taking into due account the Coulomb interaction between the nuclei and the electrons as well as inverse {\textbackslash}beta-decay. They also generalize the work of Salpeter by considering a unified self-consistent approach to the Coulomb interaction in each Wigner-Seitz cell. The consequences on the numerical value of the Chandrasekhar-Landau mass limit as well as on the mass-radius relation of \${\textasciicircum}4\$He, \${\textasciicircum}\{12\}\$C, \${\textasciicircum}\{16\}\$O and \${\textasciicircum}\{56\}\$Fe white dwarfs are presented. All these effects should be taken into account in processes requiring a precision knowledge of the white dwarf parameters.},

	abstract = {The capture of dark matter, and its subsequent annihilation, can heat old, isolated neutron stars. In order for kinetic heating to be achieved, the captured dark matter must undergo sufficient scattering to deposit its kinetic energy in the star. We find that this energy deposit typically occurs quickly, for most of the relevant parameter space. In order for appreciable annihilation heating to also be achieved, the dark matter must reach a state of capture-annihilation equilibrium in the star. We show that this can be fulfilled for all types of dark matter - baryon interactions. This includes cases where the scattering or annihilation cross sections are momentum or velocity suppressed in the non-relativistic limit. Importantly, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium, and hence maximal annihilation heating, can be achieved without complete thermalization of the captured dark matter. For scattering cross sections that saturate the capture rate, we find that capture-annihilation equilibrium is typically reached on a timescale of less than \$1\$ year for vector interactions and \$10{\textasciicircum}4\$ years for scalar interactions.},

	title = {Constraints on Phase Transitions in Neutron Star Matter},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11937},
	abstract = {Recent inference results of the sound velocity in the cores of neutron stars are summarized. Implications for the equation of state and the phase structure of highly compressed baryonic matter are discussed. In view of the strong constraints imposed by the heaviest known pulsars, the equation of state must be very stiff in order to ensure the stability of these extreme objects. This required stiffness limits the possible appearance of phase transitions in neutron star cores. For example, a Bayes factor analysis quantifies strong evidence for squared sound velocities \$c\_s{\textasciicircum}2 {\textgreater} 0.1\$ in the cores of 2.1 solar-mass and lighter neutron stars. Only weak first-order phase transitions with a small phase coexistence density range \${\textbackslash}Delta{\textbackslash}rho/{\textbackslash}rho {\textless} 0.2\$ (at 68\% level) in a Maxwell construction turn out to be still possible within neutron stars. The central baryon densities in even the heaviest neutron stars do not exceed five times the density of normal nuclear matter. In view of these data-based constraints, much discussed issues such as the quest for a phase transition towards restored chiral symmetry, and the active degrees of freedom in cold and dense baryonic matter, are reexamined.},

The number of particles which would be captured by the sun up to its present age by the capture mechanism of scattering off individual nucleons in the sun and into bound orbits is computed. For scattering cross sections not too far from the value of 4 x 10 to the -36th sq cm, which is optimal for suppressing solar neutrinos, it is found that just the right number can be captured.

	abstract = {Dark matter with momentum- or velocity-dependent interactions with nuclei has shown significant promise for explaining the so-called Solar Abundance Problem, a longstanding discrepancy between solar spectroscopy and helioseismology. The best-fit models are all rather light, typically with masses in the range of 3-5 {GeV}. This is exactly the mass range where dark matter evaporation from the Sun can be important, but to date no detailed calculation of the evaporation of such models has been performed. Here we carry out this calculation, for the first time including arbitrary velocity- and momentum-dependent interactions, thermal effects, and a completely general treatment valid from the optically thin limit all the way through to the optically thick regime. We find that depending on the dark matter mass, interaction strength and type, the mass below which evaporation is relevant can vary from 1 to 4 {GeV}. This has the effect of weakening some of the better-fitting solutions to the Solar Abundance Problem, but also improving a number of others. As a by-product, we also provide an improved derivation of the capture rate that takes into account thermal and optical depth effects, allowing the standard result to be smoothly matched to the well-known saturation limit.},

	abstract = {Neutron stars are used to set constraints on the characteristics of weakly interacting massive particles ({WIMP}’s) suggested as dark-matter candidates. Some special classes of {WIMP}’s are ruled out because they would be trapped in neutron stars, concentrate towards the star center, and become self-gravitating. This results in the formation of a mini black hole that consumes the neutron star, transforming it into a black hole, on a time scale shorter than observed ages of neutron stars in various astrophysical systems.},
